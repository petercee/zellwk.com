Good news!

I decided to open source my blog. You can see the source code (for almost everything, except credentials) over at this [Github repo][1].

## Why I open sourced my blog

I was afraid to open source my blog. I didn't want people to dig through my code and point out what I did wrong. (It's quite intimidating!).

But I've decided to open source my blog in the spirit of sharing and of [writing dirty code][2]. I hope you enjoy and learn from what I've created.

## Zellwk.com is unique

It contains:

1. A static-site generator
2. A node backend

Zellwk.com is unique because most statically-generated sites don't use a backend. They're primarily served through Github, Netlify, or other platforms.

**I use a static-site generator because:**

1. Static sites load fast
2. There's no need to create a database
3. They're easy to maintain
4. They're easy to publish

**I added a node backend because:**

1. I wanted to redirect people to a 404 page if a page isn't found.
2. I wanted to integrate my site with features I thought about (some of them requires a backend).
3. I thought it'll be fun and cool.

## Tools I used to build zellwk.com

Tools I used include:

1. Eleventy (a static site generator)
2. Gulp 4 (a task runner)
3. Sass (for CSS)
4. Webpack (for JavaScript)
5. BrowserSync (for live-reloading)
6. CircleCI (for continuous deployment)
7. Jest (for writing tests)
8. Node and Express (for the server)

I encourage you to play with the [source code][3] to find out more about this repo if you're interested.

## Why I chose these tools

Many developers have problems choosing the "best" tool to use. I want to share my decision-making process to help you choose a tool that suitable for your project.

### Eleventy

I ran zellwk.com with a custom static-site generator (let's call this CSSG) I built with Gulp for two years now. My first and obvious choice was to continue using CSSG.

But I had a problem: I couldn't test the features I built for CSSG. I was afraid to add additional features (like RSS and Tags, which are coming back to zellwk.com!). I wanted to improve zellwk.com, so I needed a static-site generator I can trust.

Switching over to this static-site generator needs to be relatively painless.

At this point, I heard great things about these static site generators:

1. Hugo
2. Gatsby
3. Eleventy

I didn't choose Hugo because I didn't want to learn Go. It was too much work to redo my site.

I didn't choose Gatsby because I wasn't a React fan. I was using Nunjucks. I didn't want to switch to React.

**I chose Eleventy because** Eleventy allowed me to use Nunjucks. The **switch was relatively painless** (still took me a week to make the switch though!).

### Gulp 4

I used Gulp 3 to run CSSG previously. It was a no-brainer to continue using Gulp to build my site.

I upgraded to Gulp 4 when I rebuilt zellwk.com with Eleventy because **I wanted to understand the difference between Gulp 3 and Gulp 4.**

This was unnecessary work. But **it was work I was interested in.**

Here, I discovered Gulp 4 had a simpler API, which means I have an easier time writing plugins to improve my build processes. For example, I built a plugin that [resizes images][4] to various widths. I'll talk about this plugin in the future when I've solidified everything.

### Sass

I've always been writing Sass. There's nothing wrong with it, and there's no reason for me to change.

### Webpack

I like writing Vanilla JavaScript. I didn't need a framework for Zellwk.com. Using a framework would be overkill.

But **I wanted the ability to `import` packages I downloaded through npm**. To do this, I needed to use a tool like Browserify, Webpack, Rollup or Parcel.

Here, **I chose Webpack because I already invested a considerable amount of work into understanding Webpack.** I tried switching to Rollup and Parcel, but I couldn't get them up in 20 mins (so I gave up and stuck to Webpack).

I decided **it wasn't worth my time to try something similarÂ **if they didn't work immediately. I could use the time elsewhere.

### Browser Sync

Browser Sync is amazing. It lets you do two things:

1. It reloads your website automatically when you change a file.
2. It synchronises your website across multiple devices for quick mobile testing.

I love it so much I want to keep using it.

If you're interested, [this article on CSS Tricks][5] shows you how to set up Browser Sync with Gulp.

### CircleCI

It's always a stressful moment to deploy ANYTHING to a server. I wanted to reduce this stress as much as possible by using a continuous integration (CI) tool.

What this means in simple language is:

1. I commit my files
2. Do a `git push`
3. The CI server updates my site

There are many CI tools out there. Examples include:

1. Jenkins
2. Codeship
3. Travis
4. CircleCI
5. Etc.

I'm not sophisticated enough to spot the difference between CI tools. **I picked the one that looked easy to begin with.**

## Jest

I tried many testing frameworks, including:

1. Tap
2. Tape
3. Mocha
4. Jasmine
5. Ava
6. Jest

I love Jest because:

1. You don't have to configure it.
2. The `watch` mode runtime is pretty sweet. No other tools have this!
3. (Also, because Kent C. Dotts recommended Jest over AVA, and I felt its a chore to set up tests for new projects for AVA).

### Node and Express

I continue to use Node and Express because:

1. I was already using it
2. I knew Node + Express backend
3. I didn't want to learn anything else right now

## Wrapping up

So there you have it.

Everyone has a different definition of what's "better". **For Zellwk.com, I chose to use tools I'm already familiar with**. I don't want to spend extra time learning similar things.

Hope you have fun going through [the repository][6]!
