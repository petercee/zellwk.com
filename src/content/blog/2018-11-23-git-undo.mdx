# Undoing with Git

At this point, you already know Git is like a save point system. What you've done so far is to learn to save. But how do you undo, and go back to a previous state?

That's what we're going to cover

{/* more */}

## Local vs Remote

It's more complicated to undo something that's already on the remote. This is why you want to keep things on your local until they're kind of confirmed.

## Four common scenarios

1. Discarding local changes
2. Amending the previous commit
3. Rolling back to a previous commit
4. Reverting a commit that has been pushed to the remote

## Scenario 1: Discarding local changes

The first scenario is when you've created some changes. They're not committed yet. And you want to delete these changes.

Let's say we want to create a new feature. We're going to add some HTML and CSS into the project:

```html
<!--In index.html-->
<div class="feature"></div>
```

```css
/* In CSS file */
.feature {
  font-size: 2em;
  /* Other styles */
}
```

To discard these changes:

1. Go to the staging area
2. Select the files where you want to discard changes
3. Right click on the files
4. Select discard changes

## Scenario 2: Amending the previous commit

When you have created a commit and you missed out some changes. You want to add these changes in the previous commit message.

You can:

1. Go to the staging area
2. Stage the files to commit
3. Click on the amend checkbox
4. Edit your commit message
5. Commit

/>

## Scenario 3: Rolling back to a previous commit

You already have a few commits in your local repository. You decide that you don't want these commits anymore. You want to "load" your files from a previous state.

You can:

1. Go into the Git History
2. Right click the commit you want to roll back to
3. Select reset `branch` to here

  alt="Reset option in the contextual menu"
/>

Note: You can only reset to a commit that hasn't been pushed into the remote.

## Scenario 4: Reverting a commit that has been pushed to the remote

If you have a commit that has been pushed into the remote branch, you need to revert it.

Reverting means undoing the changes by creating a new commit. If you added a line, this revert commit will remove the line. If you removed a line, this revert commit will add the line back.

To revert, you can:

1. Go to the Git history
2. Right click on the commit you want to revert
3. Select revert commit
4. Make sure `commit the changes` is checked.
5. Click revert

/>

  alt="Commit the changes option is checked"
/>

## Other scenarios

Github has a useful article that shows you how to undo almost everything with Git. It will be helpful if you face other scenarios. Read it [here][1].
