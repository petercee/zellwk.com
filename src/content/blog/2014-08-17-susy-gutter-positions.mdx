One question that was asked in the Susy survey I created a month ago really stood out to me. The question is **"how to remove margins or paddings of the first and last column without using first-child and last-child in the grid system?"**.

This one big question is likely one that has caused huge amounts of headaches to beginners who are just starting to learn about Susy. If we go down into the roots of the question, it is quite likely that you have used the `inside` gutter position instead of `after` after seeing the many of the tutorials online. To answer this question, you must understand how gutter position affects your layout.

I feel that gutter position is one of the more important settings in Susy because it causes you code things differently when doing your layout. If you have asked this question before, then this blog post about gutter positions is for you.

## What is Gutter Position?

Gutter position is one of the settings that Susy allows you to change for your layouts. It specifies **where the gutter should be output with reference to the columns**. It also specifies whether they should be output as margins or paddings.

It can be found in the global settings within the `$susy` map. Alternatively, you can also use it within `span` shorthands. Let's stick with the `$susy` map for this tutorial.

Gutter position is set to `after` by default in Susy, and can be changed to `before`, `split`, `inside` or `inside static`. Here's how gutter-position will look like in the `$susy` map. The items contained within brackets are other possible settings for gutter-position, and we will go through them one by one.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```scss
$susy: (
  gutter-position: after (before | after | split | inside | inside-static )
);
```

Let's create a very simple layout for this tutorial, and understand how these gutter positions work.

## After

`after` is the default `gutter-position` setting and it tells Susy to place a gutter after every single column. In this mode, **you will need to remove the gutters for the last column in the row**. Gutters are output as margins in this mode.

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-after.png" alt="" />

When using `after`, the default `span` mixin will produce 3 properties, `width`, `margin-right` and `float: left`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```scss
.test {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}
```

This will result in the follow CSS output:

```scss
.test {
  width: 73.68421%;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 5.26316%;
}
```

`margin-right` is the gutter that Susy has created for the grid.

You can use the `last` keyword with `after` to remove the final margin.

```scss
.last {
  @include span(1 of 4 last);
}
```

This sets the `margin-right` to 0.

```scss
.last {
  width: 21.05263%;
  float: right;
  margin-right: 0;
}
```

In the layout about, the content area takes up 3 of 4 columns while the sidebar takes up one of 4 columns. Sidebar is also the last item, it translates to this:

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}
.sidebar {
  @include span(1 of 4 last);
}
```

**Quick summary for after**: `after` is the most intuitive layout styles that you can start with while using Susy. When using `after`, you just have to remove the last item in the row with the `last` keyword.

## Before

`before` is another variation of `after` and the basic process is the same. Instead of placing a gutter after every column, `before` places the gutter before every column. In this mode, you will **need to remove the gutters for the first column in the row**. Gutters are also output as margins in this mode.

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-before.png" alt="" />

When using `before`, the default `span` mixin will produce 3 properties, `width`, `margin-left` and `float: left`.

```scss
.test {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}
```

This will result in the follow CSS output:

```scss
.test {
  width: 73.68421%;
  float: left;
  margin-left: 5.26316%; /* Notice this is margin left, not right */
}
```

This `margin-left` property creates the gutter in `before`. Since this is a complete opposite switch of gutters, its relatively easier to understand once you get to know `after`.

Instead of placing a `last` keyword for the last item, we just have to place a `first` keyword for the first item in the column.

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4 first);
}

.sidebar {
  @include span(1 of 4);
}
```

And we will obtain the same layout.

**Quick summary for before**: `before` works exactly the same as `after`. The only exception is that you will need to remove margins for the first item in row with the `first` key.

## Split

`split` is a totally different to both `before` and `after`. In `split`, the gutters are divided into two and placed on each side of the column. Gutters are output as margins in this mode, and there is **no need to remove gutters for at the edges of the row**.

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-split.png" alt="" />

If we only had `.content` and `.sidebar`, split gutters are easy. We just need to use the span function as we will normally do.

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}

.sidebar {
  @include span(1 of 4);
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-split-2.png" alt="" />

It won't be as straightforward though, if either `.content` or `.sidebar` contains any children elements.

Lets add two children `<div>` with the class of `.child-one` and `.child-two` respectively into `.content` to help illustrate this.

```html
<div class="content">
  <h2>Content</h2>
  <div class="child-one"><h2>Child One</h2></div>
  <div class="child-two"><h2>Child Two</h2></div>
</div>
```

And lets try the same method we used previously. `.child-one` will take up 2 of 3 columns, while `.child-two` will take up 1 of 3 columns.

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}

.child-one {
  @include span(2 of 3);
}

.child-two {
  @include span(1 of 3);
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-split-3.png" alt="" />

Notice how `.child-one` and `child-two` are completely out of alignment with the grid background!

This is because when you're working with `split` gutters, you need to be aware of parent and children contexts. The parent in this case is `.content` while children are `.child-one` and `.child-two`.

The way Susy outputs the CSS for these two contexts are very different. We need to tell Susy that `.content` is the parent with the `nest` key.

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4 nest); // The nest key is needed
}

.child-one {
  @include span(2 of 3);
}

.child-two {
  @include span(1 of 3);
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-split-4.png" alt="" />

Notice how that the background for `.content` is extending past the columns while the `.child-one` and `.child-two` are now nicely fitted into the grids.

It may be a little confusing at first. A way to remember is that you are always trying to fit children elements into the correct grids, and that you'll need to use the `nest` key on parent elements.

If you looked deeper into the actual CSS produced, you'll find that CSS for `.content` and CSS for `.child-one` and `.child-two` are completely different.

```css
.content {
  width: 75%;
  float: left;
}

.child-one {
  width: 60%;
  float: left;
  margin-left: 3.33333%;
  margin-right: 3.33333%;
}

.child-two {
  width: 26.66667%;
  float: left;
  margin-left: 3.33333%;
  margin-right: 3.33333%;
}
```

The parent element has a float the represents the percentage width of the span, without taking into account gutters (75% is 3/4).

Children elements are the ones that output all the gutters.

**Quick Summary for Split**: `split` works differently from both `before` and `after`. When working with `split`, you have to make sure to add a `nest` keyword to all parent containers and to use the `span` mixin for all child containers.

## Inside / Inside-static

Both `inside` and `inside-static` are very similar to `split`. The gutters are split up into two place placed on each side of the column. These gutters however, are output as paddings instead. There is also **no need to remove gutters for at the edges of the row**.

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-inside.png" alt="" />

`Inside` gutters have the same mechanism as `split`. If you didn't declare a `nest` keyword on the parent element, the children elements will go out of place.

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4);
}

.child-one {
  @include span(2 of 3);
}

.child-two {
  @include span(1 of 3);
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-inside-2.png" alt="" />

Just remember to add `nest` keyword to `.content` and you're set.

```scss
.content {
  @include span(3 of 4 nest); // The nest key is needed
}

.child-one {
  @include span(2 of 3);
}

.child-two {
  @include span(1 of 3);
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2014/08/gp-inside-3.png" alt="" />

`inside-static` works exactly the same way as `inside`. The only exception is that it produces gutters in units instead of percentages, and if you have given a `width` to `column-width` setting.

**Quick Summary**: `inside` works the same way as `split`. When working with `inside`, you have to make sure to add a `nest` keyword to all parent containers and to use the `span` mixin for all child containers.

`split` and `inside` use the exact same layouts, and you can simply interchange between these two in `$susy`'s `gutter-position` setting!

## Conclusion

Gutter positions affect how you would choose to write your layouts with Susy. Different gutter positions have different quirks and they need to be understood if you want to use it effectively.

There are two major patterns here:

- `before` and `after` outputs gutters to one edge and these gutters have to be removed at the extreme edges.
- `split`, `inside` and `inside-static` splits the gutters up into two and outputs them on either side of the columns. These gutters are not removed at all.

This blog post is a small excerpt of what I have in the [Learning Susy](https://learnsusy.zellwk.com) book regarding gutter position in Chapter 8. In the book, we will discuss more about these positions and actually create a more complicated layout with them. If you enjoyed this, you'll definitely want to find out more in the book! :)
