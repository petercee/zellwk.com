[Jason Lengstorf](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf) has been shooting a series of videos daily under a [#DoItAnyway movement](https://x.com/jlengstorf/status/1767381498427236838?s=20).

If you haven't watched them yet, you should.

Many of these videos contain raw content that you may need to hear. Not because they're raw, but because they show you what goes on behind the mind of one of the most prolific creators (and entertainers) in the industry.

## You probably have the same fears he has

The difference is he’s using them as inspiration for his work. So why can't you?

If you can use your fears as your inspiration as well, you open up a kind of possibility that you've never seen before.

Coincidentally, I found out about Jason’s #DoItAnyway thing right around the time I decided to do [the bravest thing](/blog/bravery) in my career.

So this is like a message from the universe egging me on.

Thanks Jason.
