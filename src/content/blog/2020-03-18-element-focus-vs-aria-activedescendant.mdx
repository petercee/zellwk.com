When you build JavaScript components, you need to manage focus for both keyboard users and screen readers. The WAI-ARIA specs say there are two ways to manage focus:

1. Using `element.focus` and `tabindex`
2. Using `aria-activedescendant`

Which should you use and why?

I did in-depth research on these two methods and I'd like to share my findings in this article. Take a seat and grab some popcorn because it's going to be a long article.

{/* more */}

First, let's take a look at `aria-activedescendant` since it's foreign to most developers (other than accessibility people).

## aria-activedescendant

`aria-activedescendant` is commonly placed on a container element. It lets screen readers identify (and hence say) the element that's supposed to be active.

You need to do four things to make `aria-activedescendant` work.

1. Add the `aria-activedescendant` to an ancestor element. This ancestor element can be a composite widget. If the element is not a composite widget, it must have a `textbox`, `group`, or `application` role.
2. Make this ancestor element focusable
3. Set `aria-activedescendant` to the `id` of the active item.
4. Style the active item so users can see a difference visually

<Callout>
  There are 9 composite widgets according to the [spec][1]: `combobox`, `grid`,
  `listbox`, `menu`, `menubar`, `radiogroup`, `tablist`, `tree`, and `treegrid`
</Callout>

Let's put `aria-activedescendant` into context by building something together. We'll let a user choose a character from a list of characters.

The correct `role` for this list is a `listbox`. Items in a `listbox` are selectable while items in a `list` aren't. Children of listboxes should have the `option` role.

Here's the HTML.

```html
<ul role="listbox" tabindex="0">
  <li role="option" id="mickey">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option" id="minnie">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option" id="donald">Donald</li>
  <li role="option" id="daisy">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option" id="goofy">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

When a user selects a character, we need to set `aria-activedescendant` on `listbox` to the `id` of the selected character.

For example, let's say the user selects Minnie. The correct HTML would be:

```html
<ul role="listbox" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="minnie">
  <li role="option" id="mickey">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option" id="minnie">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option" id="donald">Donald</li>
  <li role="option" id="daisy">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option" id="goofy">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

We also need to change the CSS so users know (visually) that Minnie got selected. We can only do this reliably through a class.

```html
<ul role="listbox" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="minnie">
  <li role="option" id="mickey">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option" id="minnie" class="is-selected">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option" id="donald">Donald</li>
  <li role="option" id="daisy">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option" id="goofy">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

For now, let's allow users to select characters by clicking on them. The JavaScript for this widget can be:

```js
const listbox = document.querySelector('[role="listbox"]')
const characters = [...listbox.children]

listbox.addEventListener('click', event => {
  const option = event.target.closest('li')
  if (!option) return

  // Sets aria-activedescendant value
  listbox.setAttribute('aria-activedescendant', option.id)

  // Change visual appearance
  characters.forEach(element => element.classList.remove('is-selected'))
  option.classList.add('is-selected')
})
```

We need to test the widget with screen readers. In this case, both Voiceover and NVDA were able to say the active item.

/>

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-listbox-click-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the clicked item"
/>

<Callout>
  There are tiny differences between what each screen reader says. It's not
  important to normalise what they say. What's important is ensuring all screen
  readers say the active item.
</Callout>

This is only level 1. Blind users won't be able to click on elements. We need to let them select options with Up and Down arrow keys.

Onward to level 2.

### Selecting options with arrow keys

Let's make things easier by setting the first element as the active descendant.

```html
<ul role="listbox" tabindex="0" aria-activedescendant="mickey">
  <li role="option" id="mickey" class="is-selected">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option" id="minnie">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option" id="donald">Donald</li>
  <li role="option" id="daisy">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option" id="goofy">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

If the user presses Down, we want to set Minnie as the active descendant. To do this, we listen to a `keydown` event.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  const { key } = event
  if (key !== 'ArrowDown') return
  // ...
})
```

We check for the currently active descendant element. This should be Mickey.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  // ...
  const activeElementID = listbox.getAttribute('aria-activedescendant')
  const activeElement = listbox.querySelector('#' + activeElementID)
})
```

Then, we find the next element.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  // ...
  const selectedOption = activeElement.nextElementSibling
})
```

Then, we set the active descendant to this new element.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  // ...
  const nextElement = activeElement.nextElementSibling
  if (nextElement) {
    // Sets aria-activedescendant value
    listbox.setAttribute('aria-activedescendant', selectedOption.id)

    // Change visual appearance
    characters.forEach(element => element.classList.remove('is-selected'))
    selectedOption.classList.add('is-selected')
  }
})
```

We do the same thing if the user presses the `Up` arrow key. Here's the complete code.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  const { key } = event
  if (key !== 'ArrowDown' && key !== 'ArrowUp') return

  const activeElementID = listbox.getAttribute('aria-activedescendant')
  const activeElement = listbox.querySelector('#' + activeElementID)

  let selectedOption
  if (key === 'ArrowDown') selectedOption = activeElement.nextElementSibling
  if (key === 'ArrowUp') selectedOption = activeElement.previousElementSibling

  if (selectedOption) {
    // Sets aria-activedescendant value
    listbox.setAttribute('aria-activedescendant', selectedOption.id)

    // Change visual appearance
    characters.forEach(element => element.classList.remove('is-selected'))
    selectedOption.classList.add('is-selected')
  }
})
```

Again, both Voiceover and NVDA were able to say the active item.

  caption="NVDA says the active item"
/>

## Element.focus + tabindex

Let's build the same thing above. This time, we'll use `element.focus` to move DOM focus instead of relying on `aria-activedescendant`.

First, we want to create the HTML. For this HTML, we don't need to give each option an `id` since we won't be using the `id`.

```html
<ul role="listbox">
  <li role="option">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option">Donald</li>
  <li role="option">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

When a user clicks on an option, we want to move DOM focus to that option. To move DOM focus, we need to make sure each option is focusable. The easiest way to do this is to add `tabindex` to each option.

We'll set `tabindex` to `-1`.

```html
<ul role="listbox">
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Donald</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

We can use the `focus` method to select the option. Here's the JavaScript:

```js
const listbox = document.querySelector('[role="listbox"]')

listbox.addEventListener('click', event => {
  const option = event.target.closest('li')
  if (!option) return

  option.focus()
})
```

We also need to change the visual style of the selected item. We can use the `:focus` pseudo-selector to help us do this.

```css
li:focus {
  background: aquamarine;
}
```

Both Voiceover and NVA were able to say the active item.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-listbox.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says the active item"
/>

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-listbox-click-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the active item"
/>

Let's move on to Level 2.

### Selecting options with arrow keys

As before, let's make things easier by selecting the first element. In this case, we can "select" an element by setting `tabindex` to `0`.

By setting a `tabindex` to `0`, we allow users to Tab to the element as we enter the listbox. We can also use the `tabindex="0"` to style the CSS.

```html
<ul role="listbox">
  <li role="option" tabindex="0">Mickey</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Minnie</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Donald</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Daisy</li>
  <li role="option" tabindex="-1">Goofy</li>
</ul>
```

```css
/* Styles the selected option */
li[tabindex='0'] {
  background: aquamarine;
}
```

If the user presses Down, we want to select Minnie. To do this, we need to listen to a `keyboard` event.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  const { key } = event
  if (key !== 'ArrowDown') return
  // ...
})
```

We can find Minnie immediately with `nextElementSibling`.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  // ...
  const option = event.target // This is Mickey
  const selectedOption = option.nextElementSibling // This is Minnie
})
```

Then we change the `tabindex` values to select Minnie.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  // ...
  if (selectedOption) {
    // Focus on next element
    selectedOption.focus()

    // Roving Tabindex
    characters.forEach(element => {
      element.setAttribute('tabindex', -1)
    })
    selectedOption.setAttribute('tabindex', 0)
  }
})
```

I found it useful to prevent the default behavior of arrow keys. This prevents Voiceover from activating "Next Item" when we press the Down arrow key.

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  // ...
  if (key !== 'ArrowDown') return
  event.preventDefault()
  // ...
})
```

We'll do the same steps if the user presses the Up arrow key. Here's the completed code (with some cleanup):

```js
listbox.addEventListener('keydown', event => {
  const { key } = event
  if (key !== 'ArrowDown' && key !== 'ArrowUp') return
  event.preventDefault()
  const option = event.target

  let selectedOption
  if (key === 'ArrowDown') selectedOption = option.nextElementSibling
  if (key === 'ArrowUp') selectedOption = option.previousElementSibling

  if (selectedOption) {
    selectedOption.focus()
    characters.forEach(element => {
      element.setAttribute('tabindex', -1)
    })
    selectedOption.setAttribute('tabindex', 0)
  }
})
```

Again, both Voiceover and NVDA were able to say the selected item.

  caption="NVDA says the selected item"

## Comparing code between the two options

The [spec][2] says `aria-activedescendant` is an alternative method to manage focus without moving DOM focus among descendant elements. This hints that `aria-activedescendant` can be easier to use compared to the `element.focus` + `tabindex` combination.

However, this doesn't seem to be the case in practice. I found the `aria-activedescendant` version longer and more complicated.

## Problems with aria-activedescendant and Voiceover

On further testing, I realised that Voiceover doesn't say the active element when used on `combobox` and `grid` roles. Let's talk about my findings on comboboxes first.

### Combobox

A combobox is an element that contains two things:

1. A single-line `textbox`
2. A popup box that helps a user set the value of the `textbox`. This popup box can be `listbox`, `grid`, `tree`, or `dialog`.

A Typeahead (often called Autocomplete) is an example of a combobox.

<Image
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/google.png"
  caption="Google's autocomplete is an example of a combobox. "
/>

I tried setting `aria-activedescendant` on the Combobox element. When I did this, Voiceover refuses to say elements that are selected with `aria-activedescendant`.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-combobox-1.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover doesn't say the active element"
/>

But it works on NVDA.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-combobox-1-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the active element"
/>

### Combobox Take 2

There's a second way to use `aria-activedescendant` with Comboboxes. We can set `aria-activedescendant` on the `textbox`. When we do this, we must also set `aria-owns` to indicate that the textbox owns the listbox.

```html
<div role="combobox">
  <input
    type="text"
    id="text"
    aria-owns="listbox"
    aria-activedescendant="mickey"
  />
  <ul role="listbox" id="listbox">
    <li role="option" id="mickey" class="is-selected">Mickey</li>
    <li role="option" id="minnie">Minnie</li>
    <li role="option" id="donald">Donald</li>
    <li role="option" id="daisy">Daisy</li>
    <li role="option" id="goofy">Goofy</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

Both Voiceover and NVDA were able to say the active descendant when the input is empty.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-combobox-2.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says the active item"
/>

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-combobox-2-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the active item"
/>

However, Voiceover does not say the active descendant if the input is filled.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-combobox-2-filled.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover doesn't say active descendant"
/>

It works on NVDA though.

  caption="NVDA says the active descendant"
/>

<p>
  <div class="kaomoji">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div>
</p>

### Grid

For grids, we can let users select one of these:

1. Select the entire row
2. Select a single cell

When I allowed users to select the entire row, Voiceover says "2 rows selected" regardless of the content.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-grid-row.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says 2 rows selected"
/>

NVDA announces the selected row.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-grid-row-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA announces the selected row"
/>

When I allowed users to select one cell, Voiceover says nothing.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-grid-cell.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover doesn't say active cell"
/>

NVDA says the cell content, row, column header, and column.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/aad-grid-cell-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA announces the cell content, row, column, and column header"
/>

## Comboboxes and grids with element.focus + tabindex

Voiceover doesn't say the active descendant when we used `aria-activedescendant` on comboboxes and rows. This is a big problem since Voiceover has a large share of the market.

How does the `element.focus` + roving `tabindex` method fare? Let's find out.

### Combobox

Both Voiceover and NVDA says the item with DOM focus when the input is empty.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-combobox.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says the active item"
/>

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-combobox-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the active item"
/>

There were also able to say the active item when the input is filled.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-combobox-filled.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says the active item"
/>

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-combobox-filled-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the active item"
/>

### Grid

When I allowed users to select the entire row, Voiceover announces the first cell in the row.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-grid-row.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says the selected row"
/>

NVDA announces the selected row.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-grid-row-nvda.mp4"
  caption="NVDA says the selected row"
/>

When I allowed users to select one cell, Voiceover says the cell contents.

<Video
  src="/assets/2020/element-focus-vs-aad/focus-grid-cell.mp4"
  caption="Voiceover says the cell"
/>

NVDA says the cell contents, the row, the column header, and the column number.

## Codepen links

I created a collection of pens (one for each test) if you'd like to run the experiments yourself. Here's [the link to the collection][3].

## Conclusion

There is only one reliable method for managing focus: `element.focus` + roving `tabindex`.

Don't use `aria-activedescendant`. It doesn't work on `grid` and `combobox` with Voiceover. I don't know how `aria-activedescendant` works with other composite widgets since I didn't test them. If you decide to use `aria-activedescendant`, make sure you test your code with screen readers before putting it into production.

I don't see the benefits of using `aria-activedescendant` since the amount of code required for `element.focus` + roving `tabindex` is similar to the amount of code required for `aria-activedescendant`.

After my experiments, I can't help but think `aria-activedescendant` is poop (just like how Heydon Pickering considers `aria-controls` [poop][4]). Of course, if I'm wrong about my conclusions, please reach out and educate me! Thanks!
