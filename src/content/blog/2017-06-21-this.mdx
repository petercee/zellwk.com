Are you confused by the `this` keyword in JavaScript? It confuses everyone in the beginning, so don't worry about it. You're not alone.

But that doesn't mean you can go on without understanding `this` forever. It is used so much in JavaScript and in tutorials everywhere that you need to grasp what `this` is sooner or later. Once you understand `this`, you'll realize that it's much simpler than you think it is.

By the end of this article, you would have demystified `this` for yourself. You'll know what it is, what it does and how to use it.

## So, what is this?

`this` is a keyword whose value changes depending on how a function gets called. There six different ways where `this` can take on new values. They are:

1. `this` in global context
2. `this` in object construction
3. `this` in an object method
4. `this` in a simple function
5. `this` in an arrow function
6. `this` in an event listener

You may wonder what `this` is in each context and why there's a need to change `this` in the first place. To answer your question, let look at how `this` changes in each of the six contexts.

### This in a global context

When `this` is called outside of any function, in a global context, this defaults to the `Window` object in the browser.

```js
console.log(this) // Window
```

<Image

  alt="This defaults to window object in browsers"
  caption="This defaults to window object in browsers"
/>

Usually, you wouldn't use `this` in a global context anyway, so the value of `this` here doesn't really matter. Let's move on to the next context.

### This in object construction

When you create a new instance of an object with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the instance.

```js
function Person(age) {
  this.age = age
}

const greg = new Person(22)
const thomas = new Person(24)

console.log(greg) // this.age = 22
console.log(thomas) // this.age = 24
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/es6/constructor.png"
  alt="This refers to the instance"
  caption="This refers to the instance"
/>

You can see that `greg` is an instance of `Person` in the code above. Now, whenever you reference `greg`, you won't accidentally get `thomas`. So, setting `this` to be the instance makes perfect sense.

Let's look at a closely related context next – `this` in an object method.

### This in an object method

Methods are fancy words for functions that are associated with an object, like this:

(Note: Methods here are defined with the ES6 object literal shorthand. Check out [this article](/blog/es6#enhanced-object-literals) if you're unsure what it does).

```js
let o = {
  // A method
  aMethod() {},
}
```

`this` within any method refers to the object itself.

```js
let o = {
  sayThis() {
    console.log(this)
  },
}

o.sayThis() // o
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/es6/object.png"
  alt="this in a method refers to the object itself"
  caption="this refers to the object"
/>

Since `this` refers to the object, you can use methods to get the instance of an object, like this:

```js
function Human(name) {
  return {
    name,
    getName() {
      return this.name
    },
  }
}

const zell = new Human('Zell')
const vincy = new Human('Vincy')

console.log(zell.getName()) // Zell
```

In these two object contexts, you can see that the changed value of `this` lets you get the right instance, which is the basis for Object-oriented programming. That's a topic for another day though.

Let's move on to the next context.

<div class="jsCkClone"></div>

### This in a simple function

Simple functions are functions you know extremely well; like the one below. Anonymous functions written in the same form are also considered simple functions.

```js
function hello() {
  // say hello!
}
```

On browsers, `this` is always set to `Window` in a simple function. The same is true even if you call a simple function in an object method.

```js
function simpleFunction() {
  console.log(this)
}

const o = {
  sayThis() {
    simpleFunction()
  },
}

simpleFunction() // Window
o.sayThis() // Window
```

Unfortunately, the change in `this` is unexpected for beginners. They expect `this` to remain the same within object methods. I got caught in it too.

To see why, consider the following code. Here, a `this.speakLeet` function is executed later within a `setTimeout` function.

```js
const o = {
  doSomethingLater() {
    setTimeout(function () {
      this.speakLeet() // Error
    }, 1000)
  },
  speakLeet() {
    console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)
  },
}
```

Unfortunately, the code above results in an error. The error occurs because `this` is set to `Window` in the `setTimeout` function. `Window` does not have a `speakLeet` method.

One quick fix is to create a variable that stores the reference to the `this`. This variable is often called `self` or `that`.

```js
const o = {
  doSomethingLater() {
    const self = this
    setTimeout(function () {
      self.speakLeet()
    }, 1000)
  },
  speakLeet() {
    console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)
  },
}
```

A second way to fix this problem is to use the new ES6 arrow functions, which brings us to the next context.

### This in arrow functions

`this` in an arrow function is always the same as `this` around it (in its immediate scope). So, if you use arrow functions within an object method, the `this` context stays as the object, not `Window`.

With arrow functions, the `speakLeet` example could be written in the following way:

```js
const o = {
  doSomethingLater() {
    setTimeout(() => this.speakLeet(), 1000)
  },
  speakLeet() {
    console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)
  },
}
```

(For more info on arrow functions, read [this article](/blog/es6#arrow-functions))

A third way to change the value of `this` within any function is to use either `bind`, `call` or `apply`. We'll look at `bind` later in the article, and `call` and `apply` another time. But first, let's go through the final context — event listeners.

### This in event listeners

`this` is set to the element that fired the event in an event listener:

```js
let button = document.querySelector('button')

button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log(this) // button
})
```

When creating more complex components, you may find yourself creating event listeners within methods.

```js
function LeetSpeaker(elem) {
  return {
    listenClick() {
      elem.addEventListener('click', function () {
        // Do something here
      })
    },
  }
}
```

Since `this` refers to the element in the event listener, if you need to activate another method, you need to provide a reference to the object with.

```js
function LeetSpeaker(elem) {
  return {
    listenClick() {
      const self = this
      elem.addEventListener('click', function () {
        self.speakLeet()
      })
    },
    speakLeet() {
      console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)
    },
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use an arrow function. If you do so, you can still get the element with `event.currentTarget`.

```js
function LeetSpeaker(elem) {
  return {
    listenClick() {
      elem.addEventListener('click', e => {
        console.log(e.currentTarget) // elem
        this.speakLeet()
      })
    },
    speakLeet() {
      console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)
    },
  }
}
```

But both methods aren't good enough to help you remove event listeners when the need arises, both are anonymous functions.

To remove an event listener, the callback passed as the second value needs to be a named function:

```js
function someFunction() {
  console.log('do something')

  // Removes the event listener.
  document.removeEventListener('click', someFunction)
}

document.addEventListener('click', someFunction)
```

(Here's [more on callbacks](/blog/callbacks) if you need help with them).

If you need `this` to reference the object in an event listener, you need to use `bind` to manually create a `this` context.

```js
function LeetSpeaker(elem) {
  return {
    listenClick() {
      this.listener = this.speakLeet.bind(this)
      elem.addEventListener('click', this.listener)
    },

    speakLeet(e) {
      const elem = e.currentTarget
      console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)
      elem.removeEventListener('click', this.listener)
    },
  }
}
```

The code above may confuse you if you've don't understand `bind`. So, before I show you what is happening, let's take a detour and understand what `bind` does.

## Changing this with bind

`bind` is a method that is present in every function. It allows you to change the `this` context. This method takes in any number of arguments and returns the bound function.

```js
function sayThis() {
  console.log(this)
}
const boundFunc = sayThis.bind(/* arguments...*/)
```

The first parameter you pass into `bind` becomes `this` in the bound function. Once you have created a bound function, you can call it anytime you wish:

```js
function sayThis() {
  console.log(this)
}
const boundFunc = sayThis.bind({ hippy: 'hipster' })
boundFunc()
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/this/bound.png"
  alt="Bind helps to change this"
  caption="Bind helps to change this"
/>

The other parameters you pass to `bind` will be passed as arguments to the original function

```js
function sayParams(...args) {
  console.log(...args)
}
const boundFunc = sayParams.bind(null, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
boundFunc()
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/this/boundargs.png"
  alt="Other params passed to bind become arguments in the function"
  caption="Other params passed to bind become arguments in the function"
/>

Note: `bind` doesn't work with arrow functions.

That's really all you need to know about `bind`.

Now, let's look back at the code to remove event listeners and dissect what is happening:

```js
function LeetSpeaker(elem) {
  return {
    listenClick() {
      // Binds this.speakLeet with a reference to the instance.
      // Sets bound function to this.listener, so we can remove it later.
      this.listener = this.speakLeet.bind(this)
      elem.addEventListener('click', this.listener)
    },

    speakLeet(e) {
      console.log(`1337 15 4W350M3`)

      // Gets the element so we can remove the event listener.
      const elem = e.currentTarget

      // Removes the event listener.
      elem.removeEventListener('click', this.listener)
    },
  }
}
```

And that's all you need to know about `this`.

Let's wrap up.

## Wrapping up

`this` is a crucial keyword in JavaScript. It appears in many JavaScript frameworks, so you have to know what it does.

In this article, you learned about the six different contexts where `this` takes on different values. You also learned how to change the `this` context with functions like `bind`. Additionally, you also learned to remove event listeners properly.

That's all you need to know about this. Just master the concepts taught in this article and you won't ever get confused anymore.

Before we end off the article, you may have heard people suggest you don't use `this` because it's confusing. I implore you to you to consider reading [this article](/blog/should-you-use-this/). It might change your view of learning JavaScript.
