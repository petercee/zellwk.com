Svelte's reactive bindings execute slower than `keydown`, `keypress`, and `input` events, but faster than `keyup` events.

{/* more */}

The order is as follows:

- `keydown`
- `keypress`
- `input`
- Svelte's reactive bindings update here
- `keyup`

You probably won't need keyboard event listeners if you're using Svelte's bindings because the bindings are usually sufficient:

```svelte
<script>
  let value = ''

  $: {
    // Do something with value
  }
</script>

<input bind:value />
```

But if you ever need them, there are a couple of ways to handle their difference.

1. Defer execution
2. Use keyup instead
3. Don't bind

## Defer execution

The first method is to defer execution of the event handler â€” so `event.target.value` will use the same value from the Svelte binding.

The simplest way is with `setTimeout`:

```svelte
<script>
  let value = ''

  function handleInput(event) {
    setTimeout(_ => {
      // Use value here
    }, 0)
  }
</script>

<input bind:value on:input={handleInput} />
```

An alternative way is to use `setTimeout`'s promise-variant to defer execution.

```svelte
<script>
  let value = ''

  async function handleInput(event) {
    await delay()
    // Use value here
  }

  function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))
  }
</script>

<input bind:value on:input={handleInput} />
```

But you cannot use Svelte's built-in `tick` function. This triggers too quickly for some reason, so the binding would not be updated in the event listener.

```svelte
<script>
  import { tick } from 'svelte'
  let value = ''

  async function handleInput(event) {
    await tick()
    // value would not be updated yet
  }
</script>

<input bind:value on:input={handleInput} />
```

Of course, debouncing works. This may be the ideal solution if you need to handle asynchronous tasks.

```svelte
<script>
  let value = ''

  async function handleInput(event) {
    // Use value here
  }
</script>

<input bind:value on:input={debounce(handleInput, 200)} />
```

## Use keyup

If you wish to skip the binding trouble, you can use `keyup` instead of other keyboard events. This assumes `keyup` works for what you're trying to do.

```svelte
<script>
  let value = ''

  async function handleKeyup(event) {
    // Use value here
  }
</script>

<input bind:value on:keyup={handleKeyup} />
```

## Don't bind

The third (perhaps most preferred) way is simply not to bind. To do this, we just set the initial `value` and adjust it whenever we need to.

```svelte
<script>
  let value = ''

  async function handleInput(event) {
    value = event.target.value
  }
</script>

<input {value} on:input={handleInput} />
```

<Callout>
  Svelte doesn't update the `<input>` element when `value` changes because `value` is only used for the [initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value).
</Callout>

## Wrapping up

That's everything you need to know about the relationship between Svelte's reactive bindings and event listeners.

This might change in Svelte 5, though I think it's unlikely. I'll update this article or write a new one when I play around with Svelte 5.

Have fun in the meantime!
