You can decide what files people get when they download your package in three ways:

1. With the `.gitignore` file
2. With the `.npmignore` file
3. With the `files` property

We'll look at each method and discuss which methods you should (or shouldn't) be using.

## Excluding files with gitignore

First, npm will check your repository for a `.gitignore` file. If there is a `.gitignore` file, npm will ignore files according to what's listed in the `.gitignore` file.

This is the most common way package authors prevent people from downloading extra files.

Let's go through a simple example. Say you have the following directory structure.

```bash
- project-name/
  |- index.js
  |- package.json
  |- node_modules/
```

Let's say you don't want people to download the `node_modules` folder. You also don't want to save the `node_modules` in the Git repository.

What you'll do is create a `.gitignore` file.

```bash
# .gitignore
node_modules
```

In this case, both Git and npm ignore the `node_modules` folder.

## Blacklisting files with npmignore

A second way is to blacklist files with a `.npmignore` file. The `.npmignore` file works the same way as a `.gitignore` file. If a file is listed in the `.npmignore` file, the file will be excluded from the package.

**Important note:** If you have a `.npmignore` file, npm will use the `.npmignore` file. **npm will ignore the `.gitignore` file** altogether. (Many developers mistakenly believe npm will use both `.npmignore` and `.gitignore` files. Don't make the same mistake!).

You can use this method if you want to exclude files from the package, but keep them in the Git repository.

Let's walk through another example. Let's say you've written tests for your package and you put them all in a `tests` folder. This is your directory structure:

```bash
- project-name/
  |- index.js
  |- package.json
  |- node_modules/
  |- tests/
```

You want to exclude `node_modules` from both your Git repository and your package.

You want to include `tests` in your Git repository, but exclude it from the package.

If you opt for the `npmignore` file method, you can write these in your `.gitignore` and `.npmignore` files:

```bash
# .gitignore
node_modules
```

```bash
# .npmignore
node_modules
tests
```

## Whitelisting files with the files property

A third method is to **whitelist** files you want to be **included** in the `package.json` file, under the `files` property.

Note: npm will prioritize this method over other methods mentioned above. This is the easiest method to limit what files others download.

This approach is pretty simple. What you need is to create a `files` property in the `package.json` file. Then, provide a list of files you'd like to include.

Here's an example:

```bash
{
  "files": [
    "index.js"
  ]
}
```

Note: Some files, like `package.json`, is [always included][1] in a package. You don't have to write these files in the `files` property.

## Which method to use?

All three methods work. Pick the one you're most comfortable with. For simple projects, the `.gitignore` file method should suffice.

If your project is more advanced, you might want to blacklist files with `.npmignore` or whitelist files with the `files` property. Pick one. There's no need for both.

## A quick tip

You can use `npm pack` to generate a package. This package includes files other people will get.

```bash
npm pack
```

Try it!
