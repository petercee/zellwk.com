## Creating tags

There are two ways to create a tag.

### The first method:

1. Go to your Git history in your Git client
2. Right click on the commit you want to create a tag at
3. Select create tag
4. Name your tag

### The second method

1. Go to the sidebar
2. Right click on the branch you want to create a tag at.
3. Select create a tag
4. Name your tag

Note: This will create a tag on the same commit at where the branch is at.

## Deleting a tag

Right click on the tag and select "Delete tag".

Select delete tag from remote repositories to delete the tag from your remote as well.

## Pushing tags

When you push changes to your remote, you can select `push all tags` to push tags into the remote. This is checked by default.
