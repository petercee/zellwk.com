Are you struggling with JavaScript?

When you face that blank JavaScript file, does your mind goes blank?

Do you wish to stop copy/pasting code or modifying what you find online, and write code from scratch instead?

Do you feel that your code is messy and you want to improve?

If you're facing any of these challenges with JavaScript, I've got good news for you. I'm writing a course called Learn JavaScript, which will guide you, step by step, to build real components from scratch.

**In Learn JavaScript, you’ll learn everything it takes – from the absolute basics to the advanced stuff – to become great at JavaScript.**

When you complete the course, you’ll know JavaScript by heart. You’ll feel confident in your knowledge, and you’ll be able to show off your ability (like ace that job interview when they ask you JavaScript related questions).

When you get a request to build something, you won’t hesitate and wonder if you can build it. You’ll know you can build it, and you’ll have the confidence to say “Sure, let’s talk about why you want this and how much you’re willing to pay for it”.

If this sounds like something you'll be interested in, I invite you to [click here and find out more about Learn JavaScript](https://learnJavaScript.today).
