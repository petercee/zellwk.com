True to my word, I spent the last two weeks diving into analytics and advertisements — mostly the tracking part of it.

{/* more */}

I decided to use the following:

1. Use Posthog for analytics
2. Use Facebook for advertisements

I’m using Posthog because it gives you 1 million events for free — and I can extend it from basic analytics to include other cool features like feature flags and A/B testing in the future, which paves the way for things I wanted to try.

And I decided on Facebook as an advertisement channel because I’ve heard some good things about it, so it’s time to try it out for myself.

My setup is pretty simple. I’m only tracking 4 events:

1. Pageview
2. Signup
3. Begin Checkout
4. Purchase

This is good enough to start.
