You would have heard of the CSS `color-scheme` property if you are interested in adding a dark theme to your website. Here's what it looks like:

```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark;
}
```

{/* more */}

`color-scheme` tells the browser to render user-agent stylesheets according to the user's preferred color scheme (which is set in their operating system).

There are three possible values (and it's super easy to understand):

- `light`: Browser will render styles according to the light scheme only
- `dark`: Browser will render styles according to the dark scheme only
- `light dark` (or `dark light`): Browser will render styles according to the scheme the user prefers

This means:

- `color-scheme: light` will give black text on a white background
- `color-scheme: dark` will give white text on a black background
- `color-scheme: light dark` or `dark light` will give either `light` or `dark` depending on the user's color scheme preference in their operating system.

## Is `color-scheme` necessary?

Most articles would recommend you use `color-scheme`.

But nope. `color-scheme` is not necessary.

`color-scheme` is not necessary because it only changes the colors in the user-agent stylesheet. If you are confident you would override all user-agent stylesheet colors, there's no need to add this extra line.

In fact, I'd argue it's safer to omit `color-scheme` when you're building Light and Dark themes... but that's a topic for another day when I consolidate all the information I found about creating Light and Dark themes.

Just my two cents.

Update: Setting `color-scheme` to would change scrollbar colors. So the property is no longer unnecessary. I'm still hesitant about using it because it may introduce more problems... but I'll leave that conversation for another day.
