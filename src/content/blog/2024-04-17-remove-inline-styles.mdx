Here's a simple way to remove inline styles from 3rd-party libraries.

{/* more */}

```js
// Replace .container with the HTML element you're targeting
const container = document.querySelector('.container')
const elements = container.querySelectorAll('*')

for (const element of elements) {
  element.removeAttribute('style')
}
```

The basic idea is we strip out the `style` tag from all elements within the container, so you don't have to fight a never-winning CSS specificity war by using `!important`.
