I've been playing around with container queries and so far, there is only one best practice that I would recommend.

**Whenever you use container queries, make sure you wrap the element with a container element**.

{/* more */}

So your HTML should look like this:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html 
<div class="container"> 
  <div class="component"> â€¦ <div> 
<div> 
```

This container should not be the element that creates a grid in your layout.

So donâ€™t do this.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html 
<div class='grid container'> 
  <div class="component"> â€¦ <div> 
<div> 
```

Do this instead

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html 
<div class="grid"> 
  <div class="container"> 
    <div class="component"> â€¦ </div>
  </div> 
</div> 
```

Now, all three code examples above assume youâ€™re using an unnamed container, which is sufficient for most use cases.

```css
.container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
```

## Thereâ€™s a reason why we need to do this

Most of the time, I would have preferred the second structure (where the `grid` is also the `container`) because I will be able to reduce the `<div>` soup in the HTML.

After all, who doesnâ€™t love clean code?

But beyond the obvious benefit (more semantic-looking HTML structure), thereâ€™s a reason why we have to use the third HTML structure which I recommend.

```html
<!-- Thereâ€™s a reason why we need this structure -->
<div class="grid">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="component">â€¦</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## If you use the second structure, you wonâ€™t be able to use container query units

These units will likely be inaccurate.

Consider this.

If you use the second HTML structure, your `.grid` will be the container.

Since your `.grid` is the container, container query units will be based on the height and width of the `.grid`. This is probably not what you want, because it can produce unintended (huge) sizes like the one you see below.

<Image

  alt="cqi unit produced a size that was too large."
/>

In this example, I set the image to `25cqi` â€” which means 25% of the width of the container.

But because the `.grid` is the container, `cqi` draws from the width of the `.grid` (which is almost the same as the browser viewport in this case). So `cqi` produced an oversized image.

These blunders can be prevented if we used the HTML structure I recommend â€” because container query units will draw its width from the grid item instead.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of what I was trying to create:

<Image
  src="/assets/blog/container-query-best-practice/cqi-just-right.png"
  alt="cqi unit produced a size that was just right."
/>

Thatâ€™s it!

This is really straightforward and I hope this article helps you prevent making some of the blunders I made when testing out container queries ðŸ™‚

As to the real reason why I made this blunderâ€¦ well I was simply trying to see if I could use `:has` to automatically make the parent element a container.

And from there, I encountered this error!
