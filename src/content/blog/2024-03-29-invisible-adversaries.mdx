In [Bravery](/blog/bravery), I mentioned I had a few fears.

These fears are real to me. They don't feel like the bogeyman that Seth Godin mentions in the [Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Practice/dp/3868818413). If they are, perhaps I haven’t summoned enough courage to look them in the eye, enough to a point that they disappear, yet.

What I know is these fears arose from a previous psyche injury. They’re present in that injured part, but not in the others.

What I have to do is:

1. Acknowledge and accept that they exist.
2. Resolve these traumas. (Programs like [TCC](/blog/tcc) can help).
3. Put them aside and continue to move towards the future that I want to create.

Invisible adversaries aren’t invisible at all. They’re just pretty well hidden. They will show up and let me resolve them as I continue to do my work.

Chop wood, carry water.
