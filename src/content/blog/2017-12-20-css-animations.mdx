The second way to animate your components is through CSS Animations. CSS Animations are like CSS Transitions, except they're way more powerful.

{/* more */}

You create a CSS Animation by defining an animation in `@keyframes`.

```css
@keyframes animation-name {
  0% {
    margin-left: 0px;
  }

  50% {
    margin-right: 400px;
  }

  100% {
    margin-left: 0px;
  }
}
```

In the keyframes above, the `0%`, `50%` and `100%` values are points on an animation timeline. It means the following:

1. Begin the animation (0%) with `margin-left` set to 0px.
2. Animate `margin-left` to 400px as the animation continues to the the middle of the animation duration (50%)
3. Animate `margin-left` to 0px as the animation continues to the end (100%)

You can add any number of points on the `@keyframes` declaration. Each point you add should be a percentage value. (You can also substitute `from` for 0% and `to` for 100%).

```css
@keyframes animation-name {
  0% {
    margin-left: 0px;
  }

  25% {
    margin-right: 200px;
  }

  50% {
    margin-right: 400px;
  }

  75% {
    margin-right: 200px;
  }

  100% {
    margin-left: 0px;
  }
}
```

If your `@keyframes` points contain similar properties (like in the above case), you can stack the points together to compact the `@keyframes` declaration.

```css
@keyframes animation-name {
  from,
  to {
    margin-left: 0px;
  }

  25%,
  75% {
    margin-right: 200px;
  }

  50% {
    margin-right: 400px;
  }
}
```

## Using the animation

You can use the animation you've created with the `animation` property. Like `transition`, `animation` is a short hand for a handful of `animation-` properties (8 in total).

```css
.component {
  animation-name: name;
  animation-duration: duration;
  animation-timing-function: timing-function;
  animation-delay: delay;
  animation-iteration-count: count;
  animation-direction: direction;
  animation-fill-mode: fill-mode;
  animation-play-state: play-state;

  /* OR */
  animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction
    fill-mode play-state;
}
```

`animation-name` is the name of the animation you created with the `@keyframes` syntax. You can include more than one animation by separating them with commas.

`animation-duration` is the duration of the animation. It is written in seconds with the `s` suffix, like `3s`. It is also a required value.

`animation-timing-function` is the timing-function used for the animation. It has the same syntax as a `transition-timing-function`. If left out, it defaults to `ease`.

`animation-delay` is the delay before starting the animation. It creates a delay for every iteration of the animation and is written in seconds with the `s` suffix, like `3s`. If left out, it defaults to 0s.

`animation-iteration-count` tells CSS how many times you want the animation to occur. It takes in a number value. If you want the animation to loop infinitely (until you say stop), use `infinite`. If left out, it defaults to 1.

`animation-direction` is the direction of the animation. More on `animation-direction` below.

`animation-fill-mode` tells CSS what to do when the animation ends. More on `animation-fill-mode` below.

`animation-play-state` determines the state of the animation. It can either be `running` (which means the animation is playing) or `paused`. If left out, it defaults to `running`.

## Animation-direction

`animation-direction` tells CSS to play the animation from 0% to 100% or vice versa.

If the `animation-direction` is set to `normal`, the animation plays from 0% to 100%.

If the `animation-direction` is set to `reverse`, the animation plays from 100% to 0%.

If the `animation-direction` is set to `alternate`, the animation plays from 0% to 100% first, then plays from 100% to 0%, and from 0% to 100% again, until the `animating-iteration-count` runs out.

If the `animation-direction` is set to `alternate-reverse`, the animation plays from 100% to 0% first, then plays from 0% to 100%, and from 100% to 0% again, until the `animating-iteration-count` runs out.

## Animation-fill-mode

`animation-fill-mode` tells CSS how to style the animated element when the animation ends. It can take four possible values: `none`, `forwards`, `backwards` and `both`.

(If the `animation-iteration-count` is infinite, this property does nothing).

`animation-fill-mode: none;` tells CSS to style the animated element CSS rules that apply to it. Nothing from the `@keyframes` declaration should affect the animation when it ends.

`animation-fill-mode: forwards;` tells CSS to style the animated element such that it contains styles from the last `@keyframes` it encountered. If the animation goes in the normal direction, CSS will style the element with properties from the `100%` step. If the animation goes in the reverse direction, CSS styles the element with properties from the `0%` step.

`animation-fill-mode: backwards;` tells CSS to style the animated element according to where it originated. In practice, this looks exactly the same as `none`. I don't see a good use case for it.

`animation-fill-mode: both;` tells CSS to apply properties in both the `forwards` and `backwards` direction. In practice, this works exactly like `forwards` most of the time. I don't see a good use case for it too.

Of the four different fill-modes, the one you'll most likely use is `forwards`.

## Animating two or more properties.

You can animate two or more properties from the same element by separating the `animation-name` property with commas, just like how you'd do it with `transition-property`.

```css
.selector {
  animation-name: slideIn, fadeIn;
  animation-duration: 2s;
}
```

The syntax is exactly the same as [transitioning multiple properties](/blog/css-transitions#transitioning-two-or-more-properties), so I'm confident you know how to take it from here :)

## Vary your @keyframes points

Setting `@keyframes` point values to standard, divisible values like 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% can make your animation dull and boring â€“ because its predictable.

You can vary your @keyframe point values so your animation becomes a bit more life-like, like the heartbeat example here:

```css
@keyframes heartbeat {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  35% {
    transform: scale(1.3);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  65% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
  80% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

## Points and timing

It's hard to time your CSS animation with other elements on the page at the same time.

For example, letâ€™s say you decide the animation should last for three seconds. You go ahead and calculate your points. In three seconds, if you want a specific part of the animation to take one second, you need to divide 100% by three. That means 33.333%.

Later, you decide to change the entire animation to two seconds, but you still want the same part to be one second. Now youâ€™re screwed. You need to redo your entire `@keyframes` sequence because 33.333% now means 0.67 seconds instead.

ðŸ˜¡.

I have to confess here, this is why I don't use CSS animations much. Whenever I have a complicated animation I want to create, I'll use JavaScript instead. Animating with JavaScript is much easier once you get used to the syntax.

## Playing/pausing your animation with CSS or JavaScript

CSS animations play immediately when the page loads. If you want to play/pause your CSS animation on an event, you need to change the `animation-play-state`.

```css
.heart {
  animation-play-state: running;
}

.heart:hover {
  animation-play-state: paused;
}
```

Mouse over the heart below and you'll see a paused animation:

IMPORTANT! Always pause your CSS animations when you don't need them! This stops the animations from moving, which saves precious computing power that can be used for other things.

## When to use CSS Animations

Now, this is the big question. You've learned so much about CSS animations. When should you use it?

Although CSS animations are useful, I recommend it only one or more if the following scenarios are met.

1. You need a complex animation that CSS Transitions cannot provide you with (like the heartbeat animation for example)
2. You need to transition more than 2 properties for a single element.
3. The animation is relatively simple. It should not be more than 4 steps. Any more, you're in for a headache.
4. You want to trigger the animation when the screen loads (without listening for any JavaScript event).

If the animation becomes complicated enough to exceed 4 steps, I recommend you animate your component with JavaScript. It's far easier to calculate and synchronize timings with JavaScript.

## Wrapping up

CSS Animations are kind of a powered-up version of CSS Transitions. They allow you to create multi-step transitions through the `@keyframes` syntax.

To use an animation you created, you can specify the animation in `animation` or `animation-property`.

CSS Animations are great for animations that are relatively simple, because of the way `@keyframes` is structured. If you want to create a more complex animation, I highly recommend Javascript to create your animation instead.
