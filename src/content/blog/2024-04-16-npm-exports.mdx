npm exports lets you specify how users can import or require your files. (For instructions on using require, see below).

{/* more */}

The basic syntax looks like this:

```json
// package.json
"name": "my-splendid-lib",
"exports": {
  ".": "./dist/main.js",
  "./components": "./dist/components.js",
  "./components/*": "./dist/components/*.js"
}
```

Let me explain what's happening.

First, `.` is the path you use for people to import your library directly. If they import `my-splendid-lib`, they are actually importing the `./dist/main.js` file.

```js
// Actual path: /node_modules/my-splendid-lib/dist/main.js
import lib from 'my-splendid-lib'
```

`./components` (or any other name) lets people import with `my-splendid-lib/components`. By specifying `./components`, you can determine what maps to. In this case, we mapped it to `./dist/components.js`

```js
// Actual path: /node_modules/my-splendid-lib/dist/components.js
import Components from `my-splendid-lib/components`
```

Finally, you use a `*` wildcard if you want to let users specify the paths themselves. This wildcard is often called a glob in the web development world.

In this case, if they imported `my-splendid-lib/components/Accordion`, `Accordion` will match the `*` wildcard. The actual file that will be imported will be `./dist/components/Accordion.js`

```js
// Actual path: /node_modules/my-splendid-lib/dist/components/Accordion.js
import Accordion from 'my-splendid-lib/components/Accordion'
```

That's pretty much all you have to know if you only use ESM!

## Differentiating Between CJS and ESM

For posterity:

- CJS means Common JS
- ESM means EcmaScript Modules

If you use Common JS, you need to `require` files. On the other hand, if you use ESM, you `import` files. There's not much of a need to support CJS today because most people use the ESM import syntax.

```js
// CJS
const lib = require('lib')
```

```js
import lib from `lib`
```

If you're writing a library that provides both CJS and ESM imports, then adding a `require` or `import` key to your `exports` map would do the trick.

```json
"name": "my-splendid-lib",
"exports": {
  ".": {
    "require": './dist/index.cjs',
    "import": "./dist/index.mjs"
  }
}
```

Now when a CJS loader requires your library, it will look under the `require` key and retrieve the `./dist/index.cjs` file.

On the other hand, when an ESM loader imports your library, it will look for the `import` key and retrieve `./dist/index.mjs`.

That's it.

Not too hard, yeah? ðŸ˜‰

Now go and write your libraries and rock the world with your creations.
