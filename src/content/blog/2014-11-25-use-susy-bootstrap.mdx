Susy is a grid layout engine that was built to help web developers create web layouts easily. It allows us to create custom grids and it does its job extremely well.

One of the common complaints about Susy is that it is too simple, it’s only the grid layout engine. There are no UI kits that come with it, and that slows down developers who want to prototype quickly.

The good news is Susy can be integrated into almost any framework or UI kit, including the major ones, like Bootstrap and Foundation.

This is precisely what this tutorial is all about – integrating Susy with another framework, Bootstrap, to be specific. Even if you are not a fan of Bootstrap, you can still glean insights on how to integrate Susy with your UI kit of choice through this tutorial.
