Many frontend developers begin styling their websites with Normalize. Some developers have personal preferences they add on to Normalize.css. I have my preferences too. 

In this article, I want to share these preferences with you. personal CSS reset (that I use in addition to Normalize.css) with you.

I categorize the resets into 8 categories: 

1. [Box sizing][1]
2. [Removing margins and paddings][2]
3. [Lists][3]
4. [Forms and buttons][4]
5. [Images and embeds][5]
6. [Tables][6]
7. [The hidden attribute][7]
7. [Noscript][8]

## Box Sizing

The `box-sizing` property changes how the CSS Box model works. It changes how `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` properties are calculated. 

The default setting for `box-sizing` is `content-box`. I prefer changing this to `border-box` because it's easier for me to style `padding` and `width`. 

For more info on Box Sizing, you might be interested in "[Understanding Box sizing][9]". 

```css
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

## Removing margins and paddings

Browsers set different margins and paddings for different elements. These default settings throw me off when I'm not aware. When I code, I prefer to set all margins and paddings myself. 

```css
/* Reset margins and paddings on most elements */
body,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
ul,
ol,
li,
p,
pre,
blockquote,
figure,
hr {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

## Lists

I use unordered lists in many situations, and I don't need a `disc` style in most of them. Here, I set `list-style` to none. When I need the `disc` style, I set it back manually on the specific `<ul>`

```css
/* Removes discs from ul */
ul {
  list-style: none;
}
```

## Forms and buttons

Browsers don't inherit typography for forms and buttons. They set `font` to `400 11px system-ui`. I find this mind-boggling and weird. I always have to make them inherit from ancestor elements manually. 

```css
input,
textarea,
select,
button {
  color: inherit; 
  font: inherit; 
  letter-spacing: inherit; 
}
```

Different browsers have style the borders for forms elements and  buttons differently. I dislike these default styles, and would prefer to set them to `1px solid gray`. 


```css
input,
textarea,
button {
  border: 1px solid gray; 
}
```

I made a few more adjustments to buttons: 

1. Set button padding to `0.75em` and `1em` because they seem like sensible defaults from my experience. 
2. Removed the default `border-radius` that's applied to buttons.
3. Forced background color to be transparent

```css
button {
  border-radius: 0; 
  padding: 0.75em 1em;
  background-color: transparent;
}
```

Finally, I set `pointer-events: none` to elements within a button. This is mainly used for JavaScript interaction. 

(When users click on something in a button, `event.target` is the thing they clicked on, not the button. This style makes it easier to work with `click` events if there are HTML elements inside a button). 

```css
button * {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

## Media elements

Media elements include images, videos, objects, iframes, and embed. I tend to let these elements conform to the width of their containers. 

I also set these elements to `display: block` because `inline-block` creates an unwanted whitespace at the bottom of the element. 

```css
embed,
iframe,
img,
object,
video {
  display: block;
  max-width: 100%;
}
```

## Tables

I rarely use tables, but there may be useful sometimes. Here's the default styles I'll begin with: 

```css
table {
  table-layout: fixed;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## The hidden attribute

When an element has a `hidden` attribute, they should be hidden from view. Normalize.css does this for us already. 

```css
[hidden] {
  display: none;
}
```

The problem with this style is its low specificity. 

I often add `hidden` to other elements I style with a class. A class's specificity is high than an attribute, and the `display: none` property doesn't work. 

This is why I opt to bump up `[hidden]`'s specificity with `!important`. 

```js
[hidden] {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## Noscript

If a component requires JavaScript to work, I'll add a `<noscript>` tag to let users know (if they've disabled JavaScript). 

This creates default styles for the `<noscript>` tag. 

```css
/* noscript styles */
noscript {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
  margin-top: 1em;
}
```

## Wrapping up

Everyone begins their projects differently. Please feel free to use any of these styles I mentioned. Here's a [Github repo][10] of my personal CSS Resets.
