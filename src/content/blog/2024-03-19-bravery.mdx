I’m in the process of doing one of the bravest things I have ever done in my entire career as a developer.

{/* more */}

The last one I can remember was putting all my courses and workshops under the name “**Magical Dev School**”. That one took lots of courage. And I’m grateful that I did it.

Now I'm defining what Magical Dev School is truly about.

## And this scares me

I've created a definition (a mission) a long time ago, and I've been hiding it away because I "wasn't there yet".

But that’s a strange thing to say. **It’s a mission precisely because I’m not there yet**. Otherwise it would already have become an accomplishment.

**I’m following my heart this time round, finally, and truthfully.**

And for the first time ever, I stopped worrying about how my business would do — because that’s no longer as important as what I’m about to do.

## Forgive me for censoring myself

I'm redesigning Magical Dev School's website as we speak.

It sounds simple. **"It's just a redesign"**. But it's also the most audacious thing I've ever done.

- I worry that some people would laugh at me for having a silly dream.
- I worry that some may mock me for believing that I’m great enough to be called a (_censored_). And that I’m going to help people become _(censored)_ too.
- I’m worried that I’m not worthy enough to lead. I’m worried that I am not qualified enough too.

But I’m going to put all these worries aside and move — and create a world where I would enjoy living in. It's important to me.

## I'm not ready to reveal what I've done (yet)

I don't want to show my work-in-progress.

I need to keep to myself until I’m ready to reveal the new design.

This may seem cowardly. But since I’m already doing the bravest thing I can do, I also want to give myself some leeway and don’t push myself too hard.

It lets me keep my sanity.

So please forgive me for censoring myself at this point. You'll see what I'm doing soon, if you continuing sticking around for the next couple of weeks.

## Why I'm writing this...

I'm writing to you today because I want to share this pivotal moment with you.

**There is a momentum that comes along when you become brave** and say (and do) what you have to. This is hard at first — since everything has inertia — but when the inertia converts into momentum. **Bravery begets more bravery**. Then at some point, you'll finally be brave enough to pursue what you really want.

Once you open the floodgates, you will see possibilities you never knew were there. If you keep the floodgates open, you wil move towards the life you've been dreaming of.

So **be courageous**. **Do what you feel you have to (and want to) to**. Open up the floodgates and magic will happen.

This brings me back to course I took a long time ago, [The Courage to Create](/blog/tcc/), which started my whole teaching and blogging journey. It was a pivotal moment that led me to where I am today.

Thank you for reading. May your courage serve you and bring you to places you truly wish to go.
