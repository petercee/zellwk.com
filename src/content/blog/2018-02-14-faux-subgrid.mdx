I was super excited when CSS Grid landed in major browsers back in March/April 2017. I thought CSS Grid was going to change the way we make layouts; it did. We gotta thank [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) and [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons) for teaching all of us us about CSS Grid.

Unfortunately, even though CSS Grid has landed, subgrid (which I consider one of the most important CSS Grid features) didn't.

But thankfully, there's a way to create subgrids with pure CSS (no hacks at all!). This method works with all browsers that support CSS Grid.

## Why are subgrids important?

When we design websites, we don't often think about how we write HTML. We usually slap boxes into a grid in our design tool and decide that's how we want our sites to look.

Most of the time, the HTML structure is straightforward. Let's say you have a 3x2 grid in a component. You can style your grid this way:

<Image
  src='/assets/2018/faux-subgrid/kats.png'
  alt='Image that contains 6 cats lined up in a grid'
/>

```html
<div class="kats">
  <h3>Kats! Kats!</h3>
  <ul class="kats-grid">
    <li><!-- ... ---></li>
    <li><!-- ... ---></li>
    <li><!-- ... ---></li>
    <li><!-- ... ---></li>
    <li><!-- ... ---></li>
    <li><!-- ... ---></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

```css
.kats-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

But sometimes, your design may call for a complicated nested HTML structure. I ran into one such case when I built [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.today). Here's the design of the component that I had troubles with:

<Image
  src='/assets/2018/faux-subgrid/learnjavascript.png'
  alt='A component from learnjavascript.today that requires a nested HTML structure'
/>

From the design, you can tell that I need a nested HTML structure that resembles the following.

```html
<div class="component">
  <h3>The 20 components</h3>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="text"><!-- ... ---></div>

    <div class="list-of-components">
      <ol>
        <!-- ... -->
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <!-- ... -->
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="sneak-peek-text"><!-- ... --></div>

    <ul class="examples">
      <li><!-- ... --></li>
      <li><!-- ... --></li>
      <li><!-- ... --></li>
      <li><!-- ... --></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

Since `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties can only be used in direct descendants of an element with the `display` property set to `grid`, I couldn't create the design directly without subgrid. I had to provide workarounds.

One way to circumvent the issue is to flatten the HTML. If I did so, my HTML would lose it's semantic meaning. (Don't do this; both Chris Coyier and Rachel Andrew have [warned us about flattening our HTML](https://css-tricks.com/will-flattening-html-css-grids/)).

```html
<!-- Flattened HTML. Don't do this! -->
<div class="component">
  <h3>The 20 components</h3>
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="text"><!-- ... ---></div>

    <ol class="list-of-components-1">
      <!-- ... -->
    </ol>
    <ol class="list-of-components-2">
      <!-- ... -->
    </ol>

    <div class="sneak-peek-text"><!-- ... --></div>

    <div class="example-1"><!-- ... --></div>
    <div class="example-2"><!-- ... --></div>
    <div class="example-3"><!-- ... --></div>
    <div class="example-4"><!-- ... --></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Another way is to force `.list-of-components` and `.examples` to be CSS Grid items with `display: grid`. This is the only viable method I know of.

```css
.list-of-components {
  grid-column: span 6 / -1;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 1em;
}

.examples {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

If we had subgrid, the above code could be simplified to the following:

```css
.list-of-components {
  grid-column: span 6 / -1;
  display: subgrid;
}

.examples {
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  display: subgrid;
}
```

We can then style items in `.list-of-components` and `.examples` as if they're normal grid items:

```css
.list-of-components > ol {
  grid-column: span 3;
}

.examples > li {
  grid-column: span 3;
}
```

Here's a Codepen for you to play with:

## Automating the "subgrid" creation process

When I created the "subgrid" above, I gave it two pieces of informationâ€”the `grid-gap` value and the `grid-column` value. Both values are vital to creating subgrids automatically with CSS.

**The `grid-gap` value** creates grid gutters (the whitespaces between grid items). If you want the "subgrid's" gutters to be the same value as the parent's gutters, you can set `grid-gap` to `inherit`.

```css
.examples {
  /* other properties */
  grid-gap: inherit;
}
```

**The `grid-column` value tells the "subgrid" two things**:

1. The number of columns to take up.
2. The position of the "subgrid"

If your grid contains columns of equal widths, the **number of columns** can be used to create the `grid-template-columns` property. It should become obvious if you look at this code closely.

```css
.examples {
  /* 12 columns */
  grid-column: 1 / -1;
  display: grid;
  /* Create a 12-column grid */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-gap: inherit;
}
```

We can rewrite `grid-column: 1 / -1` with a column number for clarity:

```css
.examples {
  /* 12 columns */
  grid-column: 1 / span 12;
  display: grid;
  /* Create a 12-column grid */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  grid-gap: inherit;
}
```

This meant we can use a **faux-subgrid** mixin to create the "subgrid".

```scss
@mixin faux-subgrid($columns) {
  grid-column-end: span $columns;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat($columns, 1fr);
  grid-gap: inherit;
}
```

```scss
.examples {
  @include faux-subgrid(12);
}

.examples > li {
  grid-column: span 3;
}
```

Here's a Codepen to see `faux-subgrid` in action.

## Positioning "subgrids" with finesse

If you need a smaller subgrid item, like what I needed for `.list-of-components`, you can still use `faux-subgrid`. The difference is you need to position the subgrid item with `grid-column-start`.

```scss
.list-of-components {
  @include faux-subgrid(6);
  grid-column-start: 7;
}
```

Here's a codepen to see this in action. (Pay attention to the two purple items on the right).

/>

## The faux-subgrid mixin

In case you missed it, here's the `faux-subgrid` mixin again.

```scss
@mixin faux-subgrid($columns) {
  grid-column-end: span $columns;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat($columns, 1fr);
  grid-gap: inherit;
}
```

## Limitations of the faux-subgrid

This `faux-subgrid` mixin is quite limited. It only works with grids with equal-width columns.

If you need to work with grids with unequal-width columns, you might want to wait for real subgrid support to come.

Note: `faux-subgrid` can also support `grid-rows`. Use the same methodology to extend the mixin if you need it.

## Wrapping up

CSS Grid is awesome; it'll be even more awesome if we had support for subgrid. Luckily, [CSS Grid level 2 specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/) are out; it seems like we'll get subgrid support soon!

(I just hope it lands in 2018 or 2019).

In the meantime, try using the `faux-subgrid` mixin I cooked up! :)
