Did your `span` or `gallery` mixin behave unexpectedly (like the image below) when you're using Susy?

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/problems.png" alt="Span and Gallery Problem"/>

You're not alone. Many people have faced the same problems I outlined above. When they meet with these problems, the common question was how to "reset" the output from the `span`, or the `gallery` mixin, so the weird behavior goes away, but that's not the best way to fix the problem.

In this article, I'm going to show you why "resetting" is the wrong approach and what you can do instead.

Before we go further, I'm assuming you know how to use Susy. If you're unfamiliar with susy, I suggest you [download seven free chapters of Learning Susy](http://learnsusy.zellwk.com) to help you get up to speed quickly.

We'll first look at the problem that arose from the `span` mixin, followed by the problem that arose from the `gallery` mixin.

## The Problem from span

Let's say you're going to create a 2-column layout.

When you create the layout with the `span` mixin, you need to add a `last` mixin or a `last` keyword for the second column. (Assuming you're using the `after` gutter-position).

Here's what your SCSS might look like:

```scss
$susy: (
  columns: 12
);

.gallery__item {
  @include span(6);
  &:nth-child(2n) {
    @include last;
    // Or @include span(6 last);
  }
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-2col.png" alt="2-column layout"/>

So far so good.

**Now, what happens if you need to change it to a 3-column layout at 600px?**

Most people add a media query to their SCSS, but they'll forget about the `:nth-child(2n)` selector they've created previously:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  @include span(6);
  &:nth-child(2n) {
    @include last;
  }

  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    // Creates 3 column-layout
    @include span(4)
    &:nth-child(3n) {
      @include last;
    }
  }
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-3col-prob.png" alt="3-column layout with problems"/>

ðŸ˜±

If you've opted to use the `last` keyword instead of the `last` mixin, here's what you'll see instead (given the same code)

```scss
.gallery__item {
  @include span(6);
  &:nth-child(2n) {
    @include span(6 last); // last keyword instead of last mixin
  }

  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    @include span(4)
    &:nth-child(3n) {
      @include span(4 last);
    }
  }
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-3col-prob-2.png" alt="3-column layout with problems 2"/>

That's even worse!!! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

But why? Why is your layout screwed so badly? Why does it contain remnants of the old 2-column layout?

This happens because the `gallery__item:nth-child(2n)` pseudo class has a higher specificity compared to `.gallery__item`. **Styles within `.gallery__item:nth-child(2n)` takes precedence over styles in `.gallery__item` because of the higher specificity.**

A quick fix is to create a selector that overrides the previous layout with the same specificity.

```scss
.gallery__item {
  @include span(6);
  &:nth-child(2n) {
    @include span(6 last); // last keyword instead of last mixin
  }

  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    @include span(4)

   // Overriding the 2-column grid to match the 3-column grid
    &:nth-child(2n) {
      float: left;
      width: span(4)
      margin-right: gutter();
    }

    // Setting last item on the 3-column grid
    &:nth-child(3n) {
      @include span(4 last);
    }

  }
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-3col.png" alt="3-column layout"/>

Although it works, you can see the code starts to get verbose.

It's an okay solution if you didn't need to change the layout at another breakpoint, but let's say you had to. You need to create a 4-column grid when the viewport reaches 1000px.

If you used the same solution, you'd notice you need to override the remnants of BOTH the 2-column grid and the 3-column grid:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  // ... 2-column and 3-column grids

  // Creates 4-column grid
  @media (min-width: 1000px) {
    @include span(3);

    // Overrides 2-column and 3-column grid
    &:nth-child(2n),
    &:nth-child(3n) {
      float: left;
      width: span(3);
      margin-right: gutter();
    }

    // Sets last item on 4-column grid
    &:nth-child(4n) {
      @include last;
    }
  }
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-4col.png" alt="4-column layout"/>

Ugh. Not very nice. We can agree that there's a better solution out there.

A cleaner way is to use the `:nth-child(n)` pseudo-class to override all gallery items. It's slightly better than overriding `:nth-child(2n)` and `:nth-child(3n)` separately:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  // ... 2-column and 3-column grids

  @media (min-width: 1000px) {
    // Overrides previous grid and creates 4-column grid
    &:nth-child(n) {
      @include span(3);
    }

    // Sets last item on 4-column grid
    &:nth-child(4n) {
      @include last;
    }
  }
}
```

Although this works, it's not the best solution since we're overriding code. It might come back and bite you a few weeks down the road if you forget about your approach.

By the way, since we're overriding every gallery item, you can technically say we're "resetting" the `span` mixin to its defaults.

**There's yet another solution. The cleanest one I've found so far.**

It is to use media queries to isolate layouts so their effects don't spill over to other breakpoints. This means we use both `min-width` and `max-width` media queries.

I've spoken in detail about why you should use both `min-width` and `max-width` queries in [a separate post](/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css), but let me explain how to use it with our current example.

First, we know the layout is two columns on the smallest viewport. Since it's the smallest viewport, we can safely use a `max-width` query to make sure styles we declare doesn't go beyond a maximum viewport width.

```scss
.gallery__item {
  @media (max-width: 599px) {
    @include span(6);
    &:nth-child(2n) {
      @include last;
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, both `@include span(6)` and `@include last` will only trigger when the browser is 599px and below.

By doing this, you'll see that each gallery item automatically returns to it's default styles (`width: 100%` and `float: none`) when the viewport hits 600px.

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-mq-transition.gif" alt="Gallery Item automatically returns to default styles at 600px"/>

With these styles, we're free to code the 3-column layout without any side effects.

Note: Some people will also call this "resetting" the `span` mixin's output. However, we're not "resetting" anything in this case. We just contain the styles such that it doesn't affect other viewports.

**In the 3-column layout,** we know there's a 2-column layout when the viewport is below 600px. We also know there's a 4-column layout at a viewport above 1000px. Hence, **we need to contain it's styles between 600px and 999px** using both the `min-width` and `max-width` query:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  // 2-column layout

  // 3-column layout
  @media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 999px) {
    @include span(4);
    &:nth-child(3n) {
      @include last;
    }
  }
}
```

Once again, you'll see that the `gallery__item` returns to its default styles at 1000px. We can then code the 4-column layout without any side effects from the previous two layouts

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/layout-mq-transition-2.gif" alt="Gallery Item automatically returns to default styles at 1000px"/>

For the 4-column layout, we know it's the largest layout of all, so we only need a `min-width` query to prevent it's styles from affecting the 2-column and 3-column layouts:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  // 2-column layout ...
  // 3-column layout ...

  // 4-column layout
  @media (min-width: 1000px) {
    @include span(3);
    &:nth-child(4n) {
      @include last;
    }
  }
}
```

**To quickly wrap up, the best way to fix the `span` problem is to isolate properties created within their correct media queries**, not "resetting" them.

## The Problem from gallery

The problem from the `gallery` mixin is similar to the problem from the `span` mixin. Here's what it looks like again:

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/problem-gallery.png" alt="Gallery Problem"/>

This problem happens to people who decide to write "desktop-first" CSS. By desktop-first CSS, I mean they write properties for desktop related styles without media queries, then proceed to add `max-width` queries for smaller viewports. Here's what it looks like:

```scss
.selector {
  float: left;
  width: 50%

  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    float: none;
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```

You can already see that coding desktop-first is complicated. You have to "reset" the styles from the previous viewport. I've written an [in depth post](/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css) on mobile-first vs. desktop-first CSS, and it's worth a read if you're confused between the two.

Let's continue the same desktop-first approach using Susy and we'll soon see why the problem happens. Let's say you have a 2-column layout above 600px and a 1-column layout below 600px.

A desktop first approach with the `gallery` mixin will look like this:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  @include gallery(6);

  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    @include gallery (12);
  }
}
```

Essentially, this code tries to override the 2-column layout by creating a new 1-column layout style. But the results you get is:

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/problem-gallery.png" alt="The gallery problem"/>

This problem happens because Susy uses the [isolate technique](https://css-tricks.com/build-web-layouts-easily-susy/#article-header-id-4) whenever the `gallery` mixin is used.

The output of a 2-column `gallery` mixin is:

```scss
// from gallery (6)
.gallery__item {
  width: 49.15254%;
  float: left;
}
.gallery__item:nth-child(2n + 1) {
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-right: -100%;
  clear: both;
  margin-left: 0;
}
.gallery__item:nth-child(2n + 2) {
  margin-left: 50.84746%;
  margin-right: -100%;
  clear: none;
}
```

The output from a 1-column `gallery` mixin is:

```css
// from gallery (12)
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .gallery__item {
    width: 100%;
    float: left;
  }
  .gallery__item:nth-child(1n + 1) {
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-right: -100%;
    clear: none;
  }
}
```

When you look at the code above, notice that Susy creates a `margin-left` and `margin-right` property for each gallery item. The negative margins here causes elements to stack together.

If you checked the code from the 2-column layout, you'd see that the way to break this "stacking" is to use a `clear: both` property.

```scss
.gallery__item:nth-child(2n + 1) {
  // ...
  clear: both;
}
```

But, there's no `clear: both` in the 1-column layout, which is why all gallery items are stacked on top of each other.

Since we know setting `clear: both` will unstack all gallery items, the quickest way will be to set a `clear: both` property on the `nth-child(n)` element.

```scss
.gallery__item {
  @include gallery(6);

  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    @include gallery (12);
    &:nth-child(n) {
      clear: both;
    }
  }
}
```

<Image src="/assets/2016/susy-span-gallery/gallery-1col.png" alt="Gallery 1-column"/>

Of course, there's a much better way. We just have to use mobile-first CSS with `min-width` media queries and the code becomes much simpler:

```scss
.gallery__item {
  // 1 column layout (no styles needed)

  // 2-column layout
  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    @include gallery(6);
  }
}
```

Hence, the best fix for this `gallery` problem is to use media queries properly too. Once again, check out the post on [mobile-first CSS](/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css) if you're unsure why this works.

## Wrapping Up

We've covered how to solve problems that arose from both the `span` and `gallery` mixin. In both cases, the solution is to write better media queries instead of trying to "reset" the properties created by Susy's mixins.

To be totally honest, I covered the best practices to create flexible grids in [Learning Susy](http://learnsusy.zellwk.com). You would have saved yourself tons of time and headaches trying to overcome such problems if you have read the book.
