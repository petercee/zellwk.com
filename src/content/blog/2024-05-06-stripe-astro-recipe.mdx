In this article, you're going to learn how to collect payments with Stripe on Astro. 

{/* more */}

To preface this article, we're not doing anything new here. Stripe already has good guides that show you how to collect payments with [HTML + Vanilla JS](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/embedded/quickstart), [Next JS](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/embedded/quickstart?client=next) and [React](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/embedded/quickstart?client=react). We're simply going to adjust the instructions from these guides to fit how I would use Stripe on Astro. 

In the process, you'll learn to use advanced Astro features like Server-Side Rendering and Environment Variables. 

You will also learn what you need to know about Stripe's API and how to use Stripe to your favour without spending hours figuring things out through their documentation. 

Let's begin. 

## Starting From A Blank Page

The first thing we have to do is start a new Astro project. Luckily, Astro makes it easy for us with the following command. 

```shell 
npm create astro@latest
```

We‚Äôre going to: 

1. Select the empty template 
3. Say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to TypeScript
2. and install dependencies 

These settings make it easy for everyone who‚Äôs following this tutorial.

## Deciding how you want to set up Stripe 

At this point, you have to decide how you wish to set up Stripe. 

You have 3 options to choose from: 

1. Use A Stripe-hosted checkout page 
2. Use an Embedded form 
3. Custom flow with Stripe Elements

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/stripe-astro/stripe-checkout-methods.png" alt="Various ways to use Stripe." />

**Option 1:** Use a Stripe-hosted checkout page ‚Äî this is the easiest option because you don't have to write any code. But it makes marketing-related tracking needs a tad more complex since you cannot add 3rd-party scripts to a Stripe-hosted checkout page. (You can host it on your own domain for $10 a month, but why waste money?). 

**Option 2**: Use an Embedded form ‚Äî this uses the standard Stripe checkout experience on your website. It is the easiest method that also lets you do tracking and almost everything you need. 

**Option 3:** Custom flow with Stripe Elements ‚Äî this lets you customize the checkout experience further, but it requires you to write code for advanced use cases like Tax calculation and Subscription. This option is also more expensive when compared to option 2. (For example, Tax calculation only begins to make monetary sense when your price is [>= $100](https://x.com/zellwk/status/1785368539106603288)). 

**We're going to use the second option.**

You can find a demo and the source code later in this guide. 

## Creating the Stripe Checkout Experience on Astro 

To create the checkout experience, you need to create two pages: (Of course, you can name them anything you wish). 

- `checkout.astro` ‚Äî this page hosts the checkout form.
- `return.astro` ‚Äî this is where Stripe will redirect your users after they have paid. 

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/stripe-astro/structure.png" />

### Building The Checkout Form 

The first thing we have to do here is load `Stripe.js` (the checkout form script). Stripe recommends we load this script directly from Stripe to remain [PCI compliant](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance "PCI compliance"). 

```html
<script src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/"></script>
```

But since we are using Astro (which contains highly advanced tooling built-in by default), we can do things the frameworky-way by installing and loading Stripe via `@stripe/stripe-js`. 

```shell
npm install @stripe/stripe-js --save
```

We can then load Stripe directly inside a `<script>` tag. (Make sure you replace `STRIPE_PUBLIC_API_KEY` with your own API key). 
  
```astro
<!-- checkout.astro -->
<script>
  import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js'; 
  const stripe = await loadStripe('STRIPE_PUBLIC_API_KEY');
</script>
```

Now let's take a quick look at how Astro handles environment variables. 

### Environment variables with Astro and Vanilla JS 

Astro lets you store environment variables in a `.env` file. I highly recommend you do this because `.env` files let you prevent your API keys and secrets from being exposed (provided you `.gitignore` this file). 

The [syntax](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#setting-environment-variables) looks like this: 

```shell .env
KEY='A Secret Key. This must never be exposed'
PUBLIC_KEY='A Public Key. This can be exposed in frontend JS'
```

Add your public Stripe API key to this `.env` file. Make sure it begins with `PUBLIC_` or you won't be able to retrieve them in frontend frameworks. 

```shell
# Public stripe keys always begin with pk
PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY='pk_<some-value>'
```

You can now retrieve your API keys with `import.meta.env.KEY_NAME`. To retrieve your Stripe Public API Key, you can use this: 

```astro
---
const PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY
---
```

**Now here's a funky thing about Astro**¬†‚Äî you cannot grab the environment variables directly in the¬†`<script>`¬†tag. (No idea why, presumably because it gets loaded differently from other Astro files and doesn't directly access Vite).

So you have to put the key into an element, then retrieve it in the `<script>` tag. 

```astro
---
const PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY
---

<div id="checkout" data-stripe-key={PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY}></div>

<script>
  import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js'; 
  const checkoutDiv = document.querySelector('#checkout')
  const stripe = await loadStripe(checkoutDiv.dataset.stripeKey);
</script>
```

I say it's funky because you can get public environment variables directly in frameworks (like Svelte). 

```svelte
<script>
  // You can pass environment variables to frameworks like Svelte directly
  const PUBLIC_KEY = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY
</script>
```

This is one of the reasons why I like using frameworks over Vanilla JS when working with Astro ‚Äî it's generally a more pleasant experience.

I've added a guide on using Astro with frameworks at the end of this article. More on this later. Let's get back to our checkout page. 

## Mounting the Checkout Form 

To mount the checkout form, we need to call `initEmbeddedCheckout` from `stripe` which takes in a `fetchClientSecret` method. 

This method needs to return a Stripe Session `clientSecret` value.

```astro
---
// ...
---

<div id="checkout" data-stripe-key={PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY}

<script>
  // ... 
  const checkout = await stripe.initEmbeddedCheckout({
    async fetchClientSecret() {
      // Return a client secret
    }
  });
</script>
```

This `clientSecret` value can only created [Stripe Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create). It requires your Secret Stripe API. 

Stripe recommends you create this `clientSecret` secret by sending an API request to your server. But we can eliminate the round trip if we activate Astro‚Äôs Server-Side rendering (SSR) capabilities. 

### Activating Astro‚Äôs SSR Feature

It's really easy to activate Astro's SSR capabilities. 

First, you need to select an adaptor. This lets Astro generate code for the server you wish to use. The choice of your adaptor doesn't affect this guide so [choose anything you wish](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#official-adapters) to use. 

We're going to use the [Node adaptor](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/). 

You can install the Node adaptor with the following command

```
npx astro add node
```

When you run the command, Astro will also include additional configurations to your `astro.config.mjs` file. 

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/stripe-astro/astro-ssr.png" />

Personally, I would set `output` to `hybrid` because I want most of my pages to be static. Only a subset (like `checkout.astro`) should be dynamic. I'll explain more about this in another recipe which I will link to at the end of this article. 

We‚Äôre done with the SSR setup. Let‚Äôs move on.

### Generate the Client Secret

Next, we can use [Stripe‚Äôs Node SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node) to create a Stripe session. To do this, we need to install the SDK first.

```shell
npm install stripe --save
```

Then we will add the Stripe secret API key into the `.env` file:

```shell
# Secret Stripe API Keys always begin with sk 
STRIPE_KEY='sk_<your-stripe-key>'
```

You can now initialize Stripe and call the `sessions.create` method.

```astro
---
// ...
const stripe = new Stripe(import.meta.env.STRIPE_KEY)
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  // options here...
})
---

<!-- ... -->
```

You need to provide `sessions.create` with a couple of options. I have detailed them for you so it's easier to understand what they do. 

- `ui_mode`: This should be set to `embedded` because we're using embedded forms. 
- `mode`: Can be `setup`, `payment` or `subscription`. Set this to `payment` if you're collecting a one-off fee, or `subscription` if you're collecting a `subscription` fee. 
- `automatic_tax`: This should be set to `{ enabled: true }` if you want Stripe to collect Tax and remit them to the authorities for you automatically. Before you set this option, make sure you [add your Tax registrations to Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations). 
- `return_url`: This is where users will return to after they have paid. 
- `line_items`: Items to be charged. 

`ui_mode`, `mode`, and `automatic_tax` values are relatively straightforward so you can add them directly without much explanation. 

```astro
---
// ...
const stripe = new Stripe(import.meta.env.STRIPE_KEY)
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  ui_mode: 'embedded',
  mode: 'subscription',
  automatic_tax: { enabled: true },
})
---
<!-- ... -->
```

`return_url` and `line_items` require a little bit more explanation so here we go. 
### Setting the return_url 

The `return_url` specifies where Stripe should redirect your user back after they have finished paying. It must be an absolute URL. 

If you're developing, the URL will probably start with `http://localhost`, but it would be `https://yoursite.com` in production. You cannot hardcode a value here because of this. 

The easiest way to set the correct value here is to use `Astro.url`. To do this, you need to set the `site` variable in `astro.config.mjs`. 

```js 
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://www.my-site.com',
})
```

Once this is done, you can retrieve the origin with `Astro.url`. 

```astro
---
// ...
// This gives 'http://localhost:port' in dev and 'https://yoursite.com' in production
const { origin } = Astro.url 
---
```

You can then use this `origin` in `return_url`. 

```astro
---
// ...
const stripe = new Stripe(import.meta.env.STRIPE_KEY)
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  ui_mode: 'embedded',
  mode: 'subscription',
  automatic_tax: { enabled: true },
  return_url: `${origin}/return/session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
})
---
<!-- ... -->
```

<Callout type="note">Leave the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` value untouched in the `return_url`. Stripe would replace this value with the actual session ID on the return page.</Callout>

### Setting Line Items

Whenever `mode` is set to `payment` or `subscription`, you need to provide `sessions.create` with a `line_items` value. This is an array of items that contain two pieces of information each: 

1. The price ID 
2. The quantity 

The price ID can be retrieved from your [Product page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products). Feel free to create a Product and add some prices if you haven't done it yet. 

Once you are done, you should be able to see your `price_ids` here: 

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/stripe-astro/price-ids.png" />

Select the IDs for the price you wish to charge your customer (for the checkout) and put them into an array as follows: 

```js
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  // ...
  line_items: [
    {
      price: 'YOUR_PRICE_ID',
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
})
```

### Return to mount the Checkout Form 

We've done a lot! The next step is to pass the¬†`clientSecret`¬†from this¬†`session`¬†into the¬†`fetchClientSecret`.

With our setup, we can pass `clientSecret` into the HTML as a¬†data variable, retrieve it in the¬†`<script>`¬†tag, and return it in¬†`fetchClientSecret`.

```astro
---
// ...
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  // ...
}) 
---

<!-- Add client_secret as a data variable -->
<div id="checkout" data-stripe-key={PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY} data-client-secret={session.client_secret}> </div>

<script>
  import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js';
  const checkoutDiv = document.querySelector('#checkout')

  // Get `clientSecret` from the element
  const { clientSecret, stripeKey } = checkoutDiv.dataset
  const stripe = await loadStripe(stripeKey);

  // Return it in `fetchClientSecret`
  const checkout = await stripe.initEmbeddedCheckout({
    async fetchClientSecret: () => clientSecret
  });
</script>
```

Now you can mount the checkout form with¬†`checkout.mount`. Here, you have to provide the selector for the¬†`checkout`¬†div again.

```astro
---
// ...
---
<!-- ... -->
<script>
  // ...
  checkout.mount('#checkout');
</script>
```

At this point, you should be able to see your checkout form when you navigate to¬†`checkout.astro`.

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/stripe-astro/mounted-checkout-form.png" />

If you set `output` to `hybrid` when activating SSR, you also need to set `prerender` to `false` for this page. Doing so ensures `checkout.astro` is not statically generated, which means `sessions.create` would create a new value for each visit.

```astro
---
export const pretender = false
---
```

Next, we have to handle what the user sees when Stripe directs them back to the¬†`return_url`.

## Handling The Return Page 

Stripe returns the checkout session ID in the URL on the return page. 

<Image src="/src/assets/blog/stripe-astro/session-id.png" />

You can use this value to retrieve the Stripe‚Äôs session, and subsequently, use it to determine what to show to users. 

To do this, Stripe‚Äôs official guides suggest you: 

1. Send an API to your server 
2. Retrieve the session object 
3. Update the DOM 

Luckily, Astro makes things easier with SSR ‚Äî we can retrieve the session information directly in¬†`return.astro`¬†before generating the page.

This means we have to set `prerender` to `false` (if you have set `output` to `hybrid`). 

```astro
---
export const prerender = false
---
```

Next, we have to retrieve the session ID from the URL. We can do this with `Astro.url`. 

```astro
---
// ...
const sessionID = Astro.url.searchParams.get('session_id')
---
```

Once we have the session ID, we can get the session information from `stripe.sessions`. 

```astro
---
import Stripe from 'stripe'
const stripe = new Stripe(import.meta.env.STRIPE_KEY)
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(sessionID)
---
```

From the `session` object, we can retrieve the user's information like `name` and `email` and output them into the HTML. 

```astro
---
// ...

const { name, email } = session.customer_details
---
<div>
	<h1>Thank you for your purchase, {name}!</h1>
	<p>We've sent a receipt to {email}.</p>
</div>
```

### Handling unauthorized access

If the URL doesn't contain a `sessionID` value, or if the `sessionID` value has been changed, Stripe will throw an error in `sessions.retrieve`. The simplest way to handle this error is to redirect users back to the checkout page. 

```astro
---
let session 
try {
  session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.retrieve(sessionID)
} catch (e) {
  // Redirect users back to checkout page if session is invalid
  return Astro.redirect('/checkout')
}
---
```

That's it for this recipe!

You can download the code for this recipe from [Github](https://github.com/zellwk/stripe-astro-recipe). Alternatively, you can also find a working example on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/zellwk/stripe-astro-recipe). 

Either way, just make sure you fill in your Stripe API keys for the code to work! 

## Additional recipes you may love 

There are a couple more things we can do at this point, such as: 

1. Use Svelte (or any framework) over Vanilla JS
2. Send an email after a checkout with Stripe Webhooks
3. Send abandon cart emails 
4. Complete the user registration process after the checkout
5. Let users upgrade/downgrade their plans with the click of a button. 

These recipes are only available for [Magical Dev School](https://magicaldevschool.com) subscribers. I‚Äôm writing them as we speak and I‚Äôll link them up as soon as I‚Äôm done.

## Parting words

I hope this tutorial has helped you get started with Stripe ‚Äî and it will help you build a thriving business!

All the best!
