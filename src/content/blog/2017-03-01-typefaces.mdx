The act of choosing two typefaces is probably the first (and often most difficult) task you do when creating a new design. Many people get stuck here, myself included.

Recently, I discovered a simple method to pair typefaces effectively and I'd love to share them with you. (Hint: it's a 3&times;3 grid).

{/* more */}

There's one prerequisite to use this 3&times;3 grid (which I will reveal shortly) â€“ knowing how to categorize typefaces. So, let's start there.

## Categorizing typefaces

On a broad level, typefaces can be categorized into the six categories. They are:

1. Sans-serif
2. Serif
3. Slab-serifs (or Egyptians)
4. Monospace
5. Script (or Cursive)
6. Display (or Decorative)

You can split typefaces into the **first three categories** by looking at the **style of the serif**.

If the typeface contains _no serifs_, they fall into the _sans-serif category_. (sans means without). Examples of sans-serif typefaces include Helvetica and Gill sans.

  alt="Image of Helvetica typeface that contains no serifs"
  caption="Helvetica doesn't contain any serifs."
/>

If the typeface contains serifs that look _blocky_, they fall under the _slab-serif_ category. (slab means a large thick block). Slab-serifs are also called _Egyptians_ even though there's no relationship between the serifs and Egyptian writing. Examples of slab-serifs include Archer and Museo Slab.

  alt="Image of Museo Slab typeface that contains blocky serifs"
  caption="Museo Slab has blocky serifs."
/>

_Any other typeface_ that _contains serifs_ fall under the _serifs_ category. Examples include Garamond and Georgia.

  alt="Image of Garamond typeface that contains serifs"
  caption="Garamond has serifs, but they're not blocky."
/>

_Monospace_ typefaces are no strangers to us developers. They're typefaces whose characters occupy the same amount of horizontal space. They're often used in tabular data and code. Examples include Menlo and Monaco.

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/monospace.png"
  alt="Image of Menlo that shows each character taking up the same amount of space"
  caption="Each letter in Menlo takes up the same amount of space."
/>

_Script_ (or cursive) typefaces are often calligraphic in nature. They're often used for short headlines, invitations and expressive text. Examples include Dancing Script and Lobster.

  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/script.png"
  alt="Image of Dancing Script"
  caption="Dancing Script is a script typeface."
/>

Finally, _display typefaces_ are typefaces that are only used for large headlines. Many display typefaces are serif and sans-serif versions that are specially tweaked to look good at large sizes. Display typefaces also include _ornamentals_ and _decoratives_, which can come in all sorts of form and styles. Examples include Freight Display and Abril Fatface.

/>
Now you know how to classify typefaces into six major categories, which is great!
Unfortunately, these major categories are too broad.

To pair typefaces effectively, we often have to drill in deeper into the subcategories. We're only going to look at sans-serifs, serifs and slab-serifs as we drill deeper since most typeface choices are made there.

## Subcategorizing sans-serifs, serifs and slab-serifs

Things begin to get confusing when you begin to subcategorize. There's a lot of subcategories, including but not limited to _humanist_, _neo-humanist_, _old style_, _grotesque_, _neo-grotesque_, _transitional_, _geometric_ and _modern_.

_Remembering_ the names of these subcategories, _differentiating_ between them and correctly _placing typefaces in them_ are three major challenges people face, myself included. After much research, I noticed you can group these subcategories into a simple **3&times;3 grid**.

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/table-empty.jpg"
  alt="Empty 3&times;3 table with serif, sans-serif and slab-serif headers"
/>

To fill up the 3&times3; grid, we can look at three properties of the typeface. They are:

1. The letterforms
2. The stroke
3. The tilt

For the first two properties, it's often enough to look at letters _e_ and _o_. The third one is a layman term I came up with ðŸ˜‚.

Let's look at each of them.

### The letterforms

Pay careful attention to the _shape of the letters_, especially of the letters _e_ and _o_. Do they look like _circles_ or _squares_? If they do, we can immediately classify the typeface as a **geometric typeface**.

**Geometric** typefaces contain letterforms that are based off shapes. They look constructed as opposed to handwritten. Because of they seem constructed, they also give off a _modern_, _cool_ and _impersonal_ vibe.

The geometric subcategory is only applicable to sans-serif and slab-serif typefaces. So, we can fill up the 3&times;3 grid as follows:

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/table-geo.jpg"
  alt="bottom and bottom left slots of the table contians the word: Geometric"
/>

Next, we look at the stroke.

### The contrast in strokes

The _stroke_ of a typeface is _lines that make it up_. Pay attention to these lines. Do they vary in size between different parts of the letters?

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/stroke.png"
  alt="Image that explains what stroke is"
/>

When we look at the stroke of a typeface, we're only interested to use it to _categorize serifs_. This is because it's rare for sans-serif and slab-serifs to exhibit any difference in the stroke.

If there's _little stroke contrast_ (little difference between thinnest and thickest part), we can categorize the typeface as an **old-style serif**.

Old-style serifs are serifs that the oldest readable typefaces (according to our current standards. Blackletter comes before it, which is hardly readable now). They mimic handwriting and are thus calligraphic in nature, which causes their letters to tilt more (more on tilt later). Since they mimic handwriting, they're often seen as _real_, _empathetic_ and _traditional_. They are also known as **humanist serifs**.

On the other hand, if there's _huge stroke contrast_, we can categorize the typeface as a **Modern serif**.

Modern serifs are deliberately constructed to stand out. Their letterforms often stand upright with zero tilt, which makes them _cool_ and _impersonal_, like Geometric typefaces. They are also known as **rational serifs** and **didones**.

Finally, what lies between modern serifs and old-style serifs are **transitional** serifs. Their _stroke contrast_ is distinguishably _larger than old-style_ serifs, but _not as much as modern_ ones.

<Image

  alt="Increasing order of contrast in stroke from the left. Garamond, Baskerville and Didot"
  caption="See the difference in strokes in these three typefaces?"
/>

After going through the stroke, our 3&times;3 grid becomes:

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/table-serifs.jpg"
  alt="Filled up serifs column with old-style, transitional and modern categories"
/>

Lets move on to the tilt.

### The tilt

If you draw a line through the thinnest points of the stroke, you'll see the stress of the letters.

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/stress.png"
  alt="Stress is found by drawing a line through the thinnest parts of the stroke"
/>

If you paid attention so far, you'll notice that stress can only be used to distinguish serif subcategories because you need to draw a line through the thinnest parts of the letterforms.

Although it may seem pointless to look at stress since we already have sorted serifs into their respective categories, I found it helpful to distinguish between sans-serif humanist and grotesque typefaces.

Let me explain.

Letterforms with a diagonal stress (like old-style serifs) looks like they're _tilted at an angle_. Since they're tilted, they mimic letters that are _created by hand_. (We don't hold the pen perfectly upright, do we?).

Although the letters _o_ and _e_ can't tell us if there's any _stress_, we can look at other letters, especially those with shoulders, like _h_, _m_ and _n_. If any of these shoulders looks as if they're _tilted_ (or if there's any stress), we can categorize the typeface as a **humanist typeface**.

An example of a humanist sans-serif typeface that exhibits this behavior is Lucida Sans.

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/tilt.png"
  alt="Shoulders of Lucida Sans seem to tilt more"
/>

On the other hand, if the letters look like they're upright, we can categorize them as **grotesque** typefaces. As you may imagine, grotesque typefaces fall between humanist and geometric typefaces.

Just to add to your typography vocabulary, grotesque typefaces are also called _grotesk_ or _gothic_, depending on the language. So, if you see these names on a typeface, you'll know immediately which category these fall under.

Want an example? How about Aktiv Grotesk? :)

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/tilt-aktiv.png"
  alt="Shoulders of Aktiv Grotesk is almost vertical"
/>

After looking at the _tilt_, we can finally complete the 3&times;3 grid:

<Image
  src="/assets/2017/pairing-typefaces/table-full.jpg"
  alt="3&times;3 table filled entirely"
/>

And with that, we're done with categorizing typefaces into their respective categories and subcategories.

Before we move onto the next section, I want to highlight that _typeface classification is highly subjective_. Everyone classifies typefaces differently so you just have to decide for yourself. Some typefaces can fall into multiple subcategories too. An example is Proxima Nova, which can fall into all three sans-serif subcategories at the same time.

## Using the 3&times;3 grid

If you searched around for typeface pairing rules, you'd often come across the following two rules, amongst others:

1. Pair sans-serif typefaces with serif (or slab-serif) typefaces
2. Pair typefaces from the same era

If you follow the first rule, you automatically create contrast with your two typefaces, which is a good thing. I explain why contrast is so important in my typography course, [Mastering Responsive Typography](https://mastering-responsive-typography.com).

The reason why experts recommend you to pair typefaces from the same era (or even from the same designer) is because these typefaces contain similar letterforms. Similar letterforms create a sense of familiarity through repetition, which is why different typefaces can blend well with each other. ([Read this article](/blog/why-vertical/rhythm) an explanation of why repetiton creates familiarity)

Coincidentally (maybe not!), our 3&times;3 grid helps you identify typefaces created in the same era without remembering the subcategories. It's used this way:

(This is mind blowing, isn't it? ðŸ˜‰)

Go ahead and try this out :)

## Wrapping up

Today, you learned how to categorizes into six major subcategories and their respective subcategories. You also learned a technique to pairing (the 3&times;3 grid).

Now go play around with the technique and let me know your thoughts in the comments!
