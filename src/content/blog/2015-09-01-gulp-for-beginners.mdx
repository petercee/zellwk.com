Gulp is a tool that helps you out with several tasks when it comes to web development. It's often used to do front end tasks like:

- Spinning up a web server
- Reloading the browser automatically whenever a file is saved
- Using preprocessors like Sass or LESS
- Optimizing assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images

This is not a comprehensive list of things Gulp can do. If you're crazy enough, you can even build a static site generator with Gulp (I've done it!). So yes, Gulp is extremely powerful, but you'll have to learn how to use Gulp if you want to create your own customized build processes.

So that's what this article is for. It helps you get so good with the basics of Gulp that you can begin exploring everything else for yourself.
