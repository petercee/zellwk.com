You probably heard of this before.

It seems to be quite popular in the web development, indie-hacking, and startup worlds.

But it’s a horrible mindset to adopt.

Because while it is a command to move fast, **it is also a command to break things**.

What ends up broken, if you are willing to dig deeper and expand yourself to see more, are usually the things that are truly important to you. **Values. Promises. Relationships**. Things like that.

I rather move with intention instead. And while I’m at it, increase my intensity as I go along.

I will end up fast and impeccable.
