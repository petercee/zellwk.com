When should you `npm init`?

Most developers run `npm init` right after creating and navigating into a new project.

It makes sense to `npm init` at the start of the project because we use npm to download dependencies. Once we `npm init`, we can begin downloading (and saving) our dependencies.

For most projects, this workflow works.

But if you're creating an open source project, the best time to `npm init` is slightly later. If you `npm init` right after creating and navigating into the project, you'll miss out a few things.

## The best time to npm init

The best time to `npm init` (for an open source project) is after you added a Git remote to your project. In other words, you should only `npm init` after you have completed the following commands:

1. `git init`
2. `git remote add origin`

If you `npm init` after you have added a Git remote, npm will generate three extra things in your `package.json` files. They are:

1. A `repository` property with a link to your remote repo
2. A `bugs` property with a link to the issues page.
3. A `homepage` property that links to the `readme.md` file.

/>

These three properties will be displayed as metadata on the right side of the project's npm page.

/>

These metadata are links. They let people move to your project's Github page easily from the npm page. You'll want these links for better discoverability.

## The second best time to npm init

The second best time to npm init is now. If you run `npm init` now, it will generate the three properties I mentioned above.

Before you run `npm init`, make sure you rename your original `package.json` file to something else. This way, you can copy-paste dependencies and other changes you've made from the original `package.json` file to the newly generated one.

## Wrapping up

The best time to `npm init` is after you've added a Git remote to your project. The second best time? Anytime!
