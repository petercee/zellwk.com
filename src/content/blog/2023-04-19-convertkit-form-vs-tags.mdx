When you're subscribing people to Convertkit through the API, you want to use a form over a tag.

{/* more */}

That's because:

- People who are subscribed through a Form will be activated (even if they have unsubscribed before).
- People who are subscribed through a Tag will remain unsubscribed (if they have unsubscribed before).

If all you need is to add a tag, then the simplest way is to create a dummy form and subscribe people through that form.

It's not ideal, but it works.
