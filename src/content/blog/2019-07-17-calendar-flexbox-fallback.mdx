I shared how to build a calendar with CSS Grid in the [previous article][1]. Today, I want to share how to build a Flexbox fallback for the same calendar.

## How to provide support

Generally, there are three ways to provide support when it comes to CSS.

**First method:** Write fallback code. Overwrite fallback code.

```css
.selector {
  property: fallback-value;
  property: actual-value;
}
```

**Second method:** Write fallback code. Overwrite fallback code in CSS Feature Queries (`@supports`). Reset properties inside `@supports` if you need.

```css
.selector {
  property: fallback-value;
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  .selector {
    property: actual-value;
  }
}
```

**Third method:** Write everything in `@supports`.

```css
@supports not (display: grid) {
  .selector {
    property: fallback-value;
  }
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  .selector {
    property: actual-value;
  }
}
```

These three methods are listed in order of decreasing-complexity. (If you need to overwrite code, it's more complicated). This means writing everything in `@supports` is the simplest of the three.

How you choose to support your project depends on browser support for:

1. The feature
2. The fallback feature
3. Support for Feature Queries

## Checking for support

The best place to check for support is [caniuse][2]. Here, I see that support for CSS Grid is decent. Browsers I have to worry about are:

1. Opera Mini: 1.42% global usage
2. Android Browsers 2.1 to 4.4.4: 0.67% global usage
3. Blackberry browser: 0.02% global usage (Not gonna worry about this one).

Support for the fallback (Flexbox) is also good.

But we have a problem: Flexbox fallback wouldn't work for Android 2.1 to 4.3 (it doesn't support wrapping). Global usage for Android 2.1 to 4.3 is 0.37%.

Here, I have to decide:

1. Is providing Flexbox fallback for Opera Mini (1.42%), Android 4.4.4 (0.3%), and Blackberry (0.02%) worth the effort?
2. Should I change fallback from Flexbox to an older feature to support Android 2.1 to 4.3 (another 0.37%)?

<Image src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-support.png" alt="" />

Let's assume, for this project, I decide that Flexbox fallback is sufficient. I'm not going to worry about Android 2.1 to 4.3.

Next, I want to check whether browsers support CSS Feature Queries.

Here, I see:

1. Opera Mini supports Feature Queries
2. Android 4.4.4 supports Feature Queries
3. Blackberry browser doesn't support Feature Queries
4. IE 11 does't support Feature Queries

<Image src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/feature-queries-support" alt="" />

## Deciding how to write fallback code

Earlier, I mentioned there are three ways to write fallback code for CSS:

1. Write fallback code. Overwrite fallback code.
2. Write fallback code. Overwrite fallback code in `@supports`.
3. Write everything in `@supports`.

If I write everything inside `@supports`, I can provide support for:

1. Opera Mini (1.43%)
2. Android 4.4.4 (0.3%)

But I lose support for:

1. IE 11 (2.3%)
2. Blackberry (0.02%)

I do not want to forsake the 2.3% of IE users, which means Method 3 (write everything in `@supports`) is out.

If I use Method 2 (Write fallback code. Overwrite fallback code in `@supports`), I can provide support for:

1. IE 11 (2.3%)
2. Opera Mini (1.43%)
3. Android 4.4.4 (0.3%)
4. Blackberry browser (0.02%)

That's everything I need. That's why I'm gonna go with Method 2.

Note: If you want to code along, you can use [demo][3] from [my previous article][4] as the starting point.

## Disabling Grid code

First, we park the CSS Grid code under `@supports` (like we discussed above).

```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  .day-of-week,
  .date-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
  }

  .date-grid button:first-child {
    grid-column: 6;
  }
}
```

We can disable the CSS Grid code by setting `display` to an invalid value (not `grid`). This disables the entire block of code.

(Thank Rachel Andrew for this neat trick. I believe I learned it from her ðŸ˜„).

```css
@supports (display: gridx) {
  /*...*/
}
```

## Writing Flexbox code

We need to build the same seven-column grid with Flexbox. The first thing we need to do is acknowledge that Flexbox and Grid work differently. We won't be able to get a perfect replica, but we can get close.

The first thing is set `display` to `flex`.

```css
.day-of-week,
.date-grid {
  display: flex;
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-1.png"
  alt="Results after setting display to flex."
/>

We need the buttons in `.date-grid` to wrap, so we set `flex-wrap` to `wrap`.

```css
.date-grid {
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-2.png"
  alt="Buttons in date grid wrapped at the edges."
/>

We need to replicate the seven-column grid. An easy way to do this is calculate the width of the grid according to the width of each button. Here, I have already set each button to 4.5ch. This means the width of the grid should be `7 x 4.5ch`.

(We can use CSS Calc to do the math for us).

```css
.day-of-week,
.date-grid {
  max-width: calc(4.5ch * 7);
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-3.png"
  alt="Wrapping at 7 columns"
/>

We need the elements in `.day-of-week` to spread out across the available width. One simple way is to set `justify-content` to `space-between`.

```css
.day-of-week {
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-4.png"
  alt="After setting space-between."
/>

Here, we can see that elements in `.day-of-week` extend past the grid. This extension happens because we let Flexbox calculate `flex-basis` for us. If we want every element in `.day-of-week` to be have the same width, we need to set `flex-basis` ourselves.

In this case, the easiest way is to set `flex-basis` to the width of one grid item (or `4.5ch`). Note: I adjusted `font-size` of each item in `.day-of-week` to `0.7em` (for visual aesthetics). We have to account for this change.

```css
.day-of-week > * {
  flex-basis: calc(4.5ch / 0.7);
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-5.png"
  alt="Adjusted .day-of-week for size."
/>

Finally, we need to push the 1 February to Friday. (Five columns). Since column is `4.5ch`, we simply push it by `4.5ch x 5`.

(Again, we can use CSS Calc to help us with this).

```css
.date-grid button:first-child {
  margin-left: calc(4.5ch * 5);
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/flexbox-6.png"
  alt="Pushed 1 Febuary to Friday"
/>

## Fixing the CSS Grid version

We can reactivate the CSS Grid code and make any necessary changes now.

```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  /* ... */
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/grid-fix-1.png"
  alt="Activating CSS Grid code"
/>

Here, we see some values fly far out to the right. This happens because we added `margin-left` to the first grid item. We need to reset the added margin.

```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  /* ... */
  .date-grid button:first-child {
    grid-column: 6;
    margin-left: 0;
  }
}
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/grid-fix-2.png"
  alt="Removed margin-left."
/>

Another thing: We can remove `max-width` because we don't need it in the CSS Code. (Even though this doesn't affect the CSS Code, we still want to remove it. Always better to have less properties).

```css
@supports (display: grid) {
  .day-of-week,
  .date-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(7, 1fr);
    max-width: initial;
  }

  /* ... */
}
```

Here's the visual difference between the Flexbox and CSS Grid versions. Not too bad!

## One fun thing

CSS Grid is cool because it follows writing direction. We can easily change the flow from left-to-right to right-to-left.

Note: I don't know if calendars are read from right to left in rtl languages. I just thought it'll fun to mention this ðŸ˜œ).

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/rtl.gif"
  alt="Switching between ltr and rtl."
/>

Our code for CSS Grid supports this behaviour naturally. If you want to support the same behaviour with Flexbox, you need to use [CSS Logical Properties][5].

<Image
  src="/assets/2019/calendar-flexbox/css-logical-properties-support.png"
  alt="Support for CSS Logical Properties."
/>

Since support for CSS Logical Properties is not-so-great, we need to provide fallback for it. (Best way is to through Method 1: Write fallback; overwrite fallback).

```css
.date-grid button:first-child {
  margin-left: calc(4.5ch * 5);
  margin-inline-start: calc(4.5ch * 5);
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  /* ... */
  .date-grid button:first-child {
    grid-column: 6;
    margin-left: 0;
    margin-inline-start: 0;
  }
}
```

That's it! Here's a Codepen for the final code:
