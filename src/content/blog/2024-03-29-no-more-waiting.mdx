When was the last time you waited for something?

Me? I hate to admit it. But the last time was today! (I've been waiting for my wife to watch a movie with me for MONTHS. And I eventually decided to stop waiting).

## Waiting = Stalling

If you're waiting for something, chances are, you're not taking active steps to make it happen.

Then you lose momentum. If you wait even more, you begin to stall. Then you will have to do all the work again to regain your momentum.

If it's important to you, best not to wait.
