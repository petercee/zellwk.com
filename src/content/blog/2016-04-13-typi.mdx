Typi is a library I've created to help make responsive Typography easy. I first talked about Typi when I released the article on [responsive typography](/blog/responsive-typography) in January 2016. Since then, I've added new functionalities to Typi to make it even better.

In this article, I'm going to tell you what Typi can do and how to use it.

Let's begin by installing Typi.

## Installing Typi

[Typi](https://github.com/zellwk/typi) requires you to have Sass installed for your project. If you're unsure how to install Sass, I highly suggest [checking this article](/blog/gulp-libsass-with-susy/) where I teach you how to setup your project with a LibSass and Susy (Sass library just like Typi).

There are three ways you can install Typi:

### Installing with Bower

- Terminal: `bower install typi --save`.
- SCSS: `@import path-to-typi/scss/typi`

### Installing with npm

- Terminal: `npm install typi --save`.
- SCSS: `@import path-to-typi/scss/typi`

### Installing with Vanilla Sass

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/zellwk/typi/releases)
- Extract it into your project
- SCSS: `@import path-to-typi/scss/typi`

Once you're done installing Typi, move on to the next step.

## Setting Up

You have to set up two Sass maps in order to use Typi. **The first map is a `$breakpoints` map**. It is a series of `key: value` pairs that tells Typi what media queries to create. It looks like this:

```scss
$breakpoints: (
  small: 600px,
  large: 1200px,
);
```

What this means is that when Typi looks for a `small` key, it will create a media query at `600px`.

**The second map that you have to create is a `$typi` map**. It is responsible for telling Typi what `font-size` and `line-height` values to create at different media queries. It looks like this:

```scss
$typi: (
  null: (
    16px,
    1.4,
  ),
  small: 18px,
  large: 20px,
);
```

That's all for the setup. We'll talk about what the values in the `$typi` map mean as we go through how to use Typi.

## Using Typi

**The first thing that Typi does is to create `font-size` and `line-height` values for your body text**. To do so, you use the `typi-base` mixin on the `html` selector.

```scss
html {
  @include typi-base();
}
```

Typi looks for the `$typi` map to figure out what `font-size` and `line-height` values to create when you call the `typi-base` mixin.

You can change the `$typi` map to another font-map by changing the `$typi` setting in the `typi-base` mixin. I highly discourage changing the `$typi` map because other mixins and functions use it as well.

```scss
html {
  @include typi-base($typi: $some-other-map);
}
```

Once Typi finds the `$typi` map, it creates a **min-width media query for each key** it finds. The only exception is **`null`**, which **tells Typi to create properties without media queries**.

From the current `$typi` map, we see that there are `null`, `small` and `large` keys:

```scss
$typi: (
  null: (
    16px,
    1.4,
  ),
  small: 18px,
  large: 20px,
);
```

Here, Typi will first create some properties without media queries since there's a `null` key.

Then, Typi looks into the `$breakpoints` map to identify the viewport values to create a `min-width` query for the `small` and `large` keys. This is behavior means Typi creates your properties with a [mobile-first](/blog/how-to-write-mobile-first-css/) CSS approach.

You can also change the `$breakpoints` map into another name that you desire if you change the `$breakpoints` setting in `typi-base`. As above, I highly discourage changing the `$breakpoints` map because the `typi` mixin (mentioned below) use it as well:

```scss
html {
  @include typi-base($breakpoints: $some-other-map);
}
```

Since the `small` key has a value of `600px` while the large key has a value of `1200px`, the CSS produced by Typi is equivalent to the following:

```css
html {
  /* props here */
}

@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
  html {
    /* props here */
  }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1200px) {
  html {
    /* props here */
  }
}
```

For each key Typi finds in the `$typi` map, it will **create a `font-size` property for the first value** in the key. It will also **create a `line-height` value if it finds a second value** in the key.

For example, the `null` key has a first value of `16px` and a second value of `1.4`. Here, Typi will create a `font-size` of `16px` and a `line-height` of `1.4` without any media queries.

It does the same for the rest of the keys. Hence, the CSS produced by Typi is equivalent to the following:

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.4;
}

@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1200px) {
  html {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
```

Typi improves on this code a little more. **It converts `font-size` from `px` to percentages** to make sure that your typography scales according to the `font-size` set in the visitor's browser (it's a best practice).

Since most browsers are set to `16px` by default, Typi uses `16px` as `100%`.

**The actual CSS produced by `typi-base()` is:**

```css
html {
  font-size: 100%;
  line-height: 1.4;
}

@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
  html {
    font-size: 112.5%;
  }
}

@media all and (min-width: 1200px) {
  html {
    font-size: 125%;
  }
}
```

_Note: Typi creates media queries in px by default. You can use mappy-breakpoint or breakpoint-sass to convert it into em queries. More on that in the next article._

That's the basics to using Typi.

## Using Typi For Other Elements

After using Typi to create `font-size` and `line-height` properties for the body text, you can use Typi to create the same properties for other typography elements (like h1-h6) as well.

To do so, you have to create a new font map for each typography element.

Let's say you have a `<h1>` that has a `font-size` of `2em` and a `line-height` of `1.2` without media queries. At `600px`, The `font-size` changes to `3em` and `line-height` changes to `1.3`. The CSS code for this `<h1>` element is:

```scss
h1 {
  font-size: 2em;
  line-height: 1.2;
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 3em;
    line-height: 1.3;
  }
}
```

In Typi, what you'll do is to create a font-map that contains these `font-size` and `line-height` values at different breakpoints. These font maps work exactly the same as the `$typi` map.

```scss
$h1-font-map: (
  null: (
    2em,
    1.2,
  ),
  small: (
    3em,
    1.3,
  ),
);
```

Once you've created the font-map, you can use the `typi` mixin to create the `font-size` and `line-height` properties. It takes in one required argument, the font map that you intend to create:

```scss
h1 {
  @include typi($h1-font-map);
}
```

_Note: if you changed the `$breakpoints` or `$typi` map in `typi-base`, you have to change them in every `typi` mixin as well_:

```scss
h1 {
  @include typi(
    $h1-font-map,
    $breakpoints: $some-breakpoint-map $typi: $some-typi-map
  );
}
```

The `typi` mixin does the same thing as the `typi-base` mixin. The difference is that it creates `font-size` in `rems` instead of percentages. [Check out this post](/blog/rem-vs-em) if you're wondering why I use rem typography.

The CSS produced by `@include typi($h1-font-map)` is:

```scss
h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  line-height: 1.2;
}

@media all and (min-width: 600px) {
  h1 {
    font-size: 3rem;
    line-height: 1.3;
  }
}
```

You can create an unlimited number of font-maps with Typi if you wish to. Just use them in their respective selectors.

```scss
$h1-font-map: (//... );
$h2-font-map: (//... );
$h3-font-map: (//... );
// ...

h1 { @include typi($h1-font-map); }
h2 { @include typi($h2-font-map); }
h3 { @include typi($h3-font-map); }
```

This is how you can use Typi to create `font-size` and `line-height` properties easily for multiple elements without writing media queries yourself.

## Using Typi for Vertical Rhythm

Vertical Rhythm is a concept that originated from print typography. In Vertical Rhythm, we try to keep vertical spaces between elements on a page consistent with each other.

This means that we have two rules to follow:

1. Set the **vertical white space between elements** to a **multiple of the baseline**.
2. Set the **line-height of all text elements** to a **multiple of the baseline**.

_Note: [check this post out](/blog/why-vertical-rhythms) if you want to find out more about Vertical Rhythm._

**Calculating Vertical Rhythm is a chore.**

Let's use the `font-size` and `line-height` values we have to illustrate why.

Right now, the `font-size` is `16px` and the `line-height` is `1.4`. This means one baseline is `16px * 1.4 = 22.4px.`

We have to convert the `22.4px` into a relative unit because it allows us to scale typography easily ([Check this post if you need proof](/blog/responsive-typography)). The best to do so is to convert it into rem.

Hence, one baseline is equal to `1.4rem`.

Since we're building with Vertical Rhythm, we need to use a multiple of `1.4rem` everywhere in the CSS. It's common to see code like this:

```scss
.selector {
  margin: 4.2rem; // value 3 baselines
  padding: 2.8rem; // value of 2 baselines
}
```

Here, we've calculated `4.2rem` and `2.8rem` manually. It's not big of a deal when working with small sites, but the cognitive power required increases as your site complexity increases.

Typi helps to remove the need for this math by providing you with a `vr` function that takes in a multiple of the baseline.

So, the above code will turn into this:

```scss
.selector {
  margin: vr(3); // value 3 baselines
  padding: vr(2); // value of 2 baselines
}
```

Much easier, isn't it? :)

There's only one prerequisite for using Typi to create Vertical Rhythm. You need to specify a `line-height` value in the `$typi` map's `null` key (which you should already have):

```scss
$typi: (
  null: (
    16px,
    1.4,
  ),
);
```

That's it for using the `vr` function to calculate baselines.

## Wrapping Up

In this article, you learned how to use the `typi-base` and `typi` mixins to create `font-size` and `line-height` properties. You also learned how to use the `vr` function in Typi to create Vertical Rhythm without complex math.

There's a lot more to Typi than I can finish in one article. In the next one, I'll show you some advanced techniques you can use with Typi to make it easier to write responsive typography.

Meanwhile, give Typi a go and let me know what you think about it in the comments! :)
