Many people feel that `this` is incredibly confusing. Because it's so confusing, they argue that `this` makes JavaScript complicated, and you should avoid them like a plague.

But does `this` really make your JavaScript complicated? Should you avoid using `this`?

## Don't avoid this

`this` doesn't make JavaScript complicated like what people have suggested. These people only feel that `this` is complicated because they don't fully understand it. Because they don't understand `this`, they dissuade people from using it under the pretext of complexity and confusion.

As I explained in [a separate article](/blog/this/), `this` can take six possible values depending its context. Six is a relatively easy number to conquer, isn't it?

If you can't understand `this`, you'll likely find it difficult to understand JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. You'll find it hard to become fluent in JavaScript.

`this` is a JavaScript fundamental. Don't shy away from it. Give yourself the chance to understand it.

## Learn this regardless of what people say

JavaScript is a language that supports two main programming styles â€“ object oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP).

**Object oriented programming** is a style that revolves around creating "objects". It uses `this` heavily to access properties and methods.

```js
const Obj = function () {
  return {
    prop: 'yay',
    method: function () {
      // access prop in the same object
      console.log(this.prop)
    },
  }
}
```

**Functional programming** is a style that revolves around performing actions through function calls. It doesn't use `this` at all.

```js
const partialResult = someFunction(data)
const finalResult = anotherFunction(partialResult)
```

When viewed this way, whether to use `this` becomes a bigger question of whether to use OOP or FP. Both approaches has their merits and are favored by many experts.

If you choose FP over OOP because you're afraid of `this`, you're effectively condemning half of the JS population without even understanding why.

To make a conscious choice, you need to start by understanding wtf `this` is.

Besides, OOP is so popular in JavaScript that you'll definitely encounter instances of `this` in libraries. If you don't understand `this`, you'll likely have a hard time understanding the library. Examples of popular libraries that use `this` include React and Mongoose.

## When do you use this?

`this` is crucial in OOP. So, when you use OOP, you definitely need to rely on `this`. When you don't write OOP, you don't use `this`.

With this constrain in place, you only need to know four of six possible contexts. Do you know what they are?

Have a guess :)

You might want to refer back to [this article](/blog/this) to help you figure it out.

## Wrapping up

Learn `this`.

Learn it even though others tell you it's complicated. Learn it, because it sounds confusing. Learn it and give yourself the chance to fully understand what `this` is.

Don't shy away from `this`. Don't shy away from the chance to become a better developer.

Learn `this` so you can use it effectively when you encounter it.
