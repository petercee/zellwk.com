The simplest form on the web contains an email field and a submit button. Sometimes, the email field and the submit button is placed on the same row, like this:

<Image

  caption="Email and submit button on the same row"
/>

This UI looks simple! But it can be difficult to build if you're using older methods like `inline-block`. The hard part is getting the email field and button to align visually.

The great news is: CSS Grid or Flexbox can help you build this form easily.

## Making the form with Flexbox

From the picture above, we know the form contains two elements:

1. An email field
2. A submit button

Here's the HTML:

```html
<form>
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <button type="submit">Subscribe!</button>
</form>
```

Here's what you have when you write the HTML (after styling for appearance).

<Image
  src="/assets/2018/simple-form-flexbox/before.png"
  alt="Input and Button elements are both inline-block elements"
  caption="Input and Button elements are both inline-block elements"
/>

Both `input` and `button` are `inline-block` elements. When you place inline-block elements together, you'll get a whitespace of about 3-4 px between them. (You'll also get whitespace of 3-4px at the bottom of each `inline-block` element).

To fix this whitespace issue, you can change `input`'s and `button`'s display property. One way is to use Flexbox.

If you use Flexbox, you want to set the parent element's display property to `flex`.

```css
form {
  display: flex;
}
```

Here’s what you get once you set the display to flex:

<Image
  src="/assets/2018/simple-form-flexbox/flexboxed.png"
  alt="Whitespace between elements disappeared we used Flexbox"
  caption="Whitespace between elements disappeared we changed to Flexbox"
/>

Next.

You want to give a user as much space as possible to fill in their email address. We don't have enough space in our example now.

To increase whitespace, we can ask the `input` element to grow so it takes up all extra space available. You can do this by setting `flex-grow` to `1`.

```css
input {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

<Image

  caption="Email field grew to take up any available spaces"
/>

Here's a Codepen to try this out:

## When elements are of unequal height...

This technique helps a lot if your `input` and `button` elements are of unequal height. We'll simulate this by substituting the `<button>` text with an SVG. We'll also make this SVG bigger than the `input` text.

```html
<form action="#">
  <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" />
  <button type="button">
    <svg><!-- a smiley icon --></svg>
  </button>
</form>
```

<Image
  src="/assets/2018/simple-form-flexbox/smiley.png"
  alt="Adding a smiley icon as the to the submit button"
  caption="Adding a smiley icon as the to the submit button"
/>

Notice the `input`'s height increases to fit the large SVG icon. We didn't have to write any extra code! This happens because all elements are stretched vertically to fill up any available space by default.

If you want to change this behavior, you can change the `align-items` property to either `flex-start`, `flex-end`, or `center`.

<Image
  src="/assets/2018/simple-form-flexbox/align-items.png"
  caption="Items can be aligned differently if you set `align-itemns` to a different value"
/>

Notice there's some extra space below the SVG icon. There's an extra space because SVGs are `inline-block` elements by default. And `inline-block` elements have a 3-4px whitespace below them (mentioned above).

To fix this space below the SVG icon, we can change the SVG's `display` property to `block`.

## Wrapping up

Flexbox makes it easy to align elements with unequal height. CSS Grid does the same too! I'll show you how to create the same form with CSS Grid in the next article. a
